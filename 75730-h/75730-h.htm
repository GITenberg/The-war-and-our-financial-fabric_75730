</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> this work I attempt to gather up some of the
lessons to be learnt from the experiences of the
greatest of financial crises. Many predictions have
been unrealized and many theories destroyed, and we
are able, I think, to see with greater clearness and
to grasp with more boldness the problems that perplexed
us in the past. Banking, credit and currency
problems have ever been subjects of contentious
controversy, experts and academic critics alike being
unable to agree upon their reading of phenomena
and upon right interpretations. The problems are
indisputably complex, the most complex, probably, in
the vast domain of economics, and vision and logic
have not guided us with sureness amidst their intricacies.
Hence we have groped and gone our
different ways, finding ourselves at no common goal.
Royal Commissions have been asked for in order to
tackle and, if possible, to find solutions that will be
universally acceptable. For some time before last
year’s crisis a small committee of bankers had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
sitting in order primarily to deal with the reserve
problem and the provision of emergency currency.
It is believed they were on the point of presenting
a scheme to deal with future crises when the sudden
outbreak of the war put an end to their labours.
Whether or not their scheme will ever be made known
to the public may depend upon future developments.
Perhaps the public may never be enlightened, for
it may now be thought that inspiration and genius
discovered the most practical solutions at the right
moments. Something had to be done swiftly. And
that which was decided upon swiftly revealed deeper
insight, maybe, than slower deliberation.</p>

<p>This is not uncommon, however, in the career of
genius. Civilization has profited more, perhaps, from
flashes of inspiration than from uninspired controversy.</p>

<p>In order to build up my arguments I start from
the foundation, and in the earlier chapters deal
with the monetary problem and the general working
of the banking system. These lead us into the region
of dialectics and controversy and to a survey of the
happenings during the crisis.</p>

<p>I urge amongst other contentions that banks do
not in the true connotation of the word create credit.
If it be possible to convince ourselves that they do
not create credit, that credit is a something existing
prior to and independently of banking, it will, I
think, make the gold reserve problem easier to solve.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
What we gaze upon is not an unsubstantial structure
called in Lombard Street “the superstructure of
credit,” but is something more solid. It is a superstructure
of wealth. All that banks do is to transform
this wealth into liquid capital, resolve it into
its constituent, or original, elements. This enables
wealth to perform its fructifying functions, to reproduce
itself, just as the mature fruit reproduces itself
when re-sown. Were the wealth to remain in its
fixed, or, as the market would say, its frozen form,
what sort of wealth-harvest could we hope to gather
from it? Unless it be made liquid it cannot flow.
And if it did not flow, but remained frozen,
sterility would result. If this transforming machinery
were not provided by banks, the Government,
on the nation’s behalf, would have to provide
it, or the nation would become inert. As there is
not, and never can be, enough legal tender coinage
for this work, other legal tender currency should be
provided.</p>

<p>In answer to those who have ever clamoured
for high gold reserves I have endeavoured to show
the impossibility, in the present system, of this
realization. What critics have at the back of their
consciousness is, not quantity <i lang="la">per se</i>, but proportion.
They do not mean a mere counting of sovereigns,
but the ratio of an individual bank’s reserve to
its liabilities. A small bank cannot have as much
gold as a large bank, but it can have as high a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
proportion. Now, a high proportion can be attained
only by keeping down the loan-deposits. It cannot be
attained by getting a larger quantity of gold if the
loan-deposits grow correspondingly. When banks see
these deposits rising and the proportion falling, they
cease lending, call in their loans, and allow the proportion
to rise. We then see what we fallaciously
call the loan-fund of Lombard Street diminish,
showing that the loan-fund is not in the deposits,
but in the gold reserves and in the totality of the
wealth in the keeping of the banks at any given
moment.</p>

<p>When banks cease to lend they drive borrowers
to the Bank of England. Borrowing there causes a
drop in the Bank’s proportion. Therefore, we cannot
have simultaneously high proportions of joint stock
bank reserves and a high proportion of a Bank of
England reserve unless both stop lending simultaneously.
As the Bank’s reserve is the reserve of
the joint stock banks collectively and the national
reserve, then, if its proportion falls, the reserve-proportion
of the entire system falls. The only way
to keep it high is for all to stop lending and for
the whole money market to lapse into a state of
stagnation. So far as my knowledge extends, this
has not been pointed out.</p>

<p>We know that efforts are made, by raising the
Bank rate, to replenish the reserve automatically from
outside sources. But whether the gold flows in or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
not, it does not disprove the fact that a high proportion
in the independent joint stock banks and
in the independent Bank of England cannot be
maintained at simultaneous moments except by a
simultaneous refusal to lend. It needs no exceptional
power of imagination to picture what would result
from this action. It would have the same consequences
as a great destruction of capital by war or any other
calamity. If we had an elastic legal tender system,
to provide for what I call a supplementary inflow of
legal tender, we could avoid many inconveniences
from which the money market and the nation
suffers.</p>

<p>The supply of liquid capital in a perfect economic
system should keep pace with the output of wealth.
But our system is not perfect. Progress must
necessarily be impeded by artificial and arbitrary
restrictions.</p>

<p>I think, too, we could simplify the problem by
segregating the composite deposits of a bank. These
deposits are an aggregation of what I call, for lack
of something more precise, pure deposits and loan-deposits.
The loan-deposits are debts to the bank,
which the bank has power to call in. If these loan-depositors
have legal power to withdraw money on
demand, the banks have power to withdraw from
many of them on demand. On the approach of a
crisis, or stringency, they do this, though in certain
contingencies such withdrawals might precipitate a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
crisis. Nevertheless, the important fact remains that
they have power to call them in.</p>

<p>If we set the gold reserves against the pure
deposits we shall find that the reserve is invariably
high.</p>

<p>But why do we want a high proportion? Why
do we wish to hoard gold, when we know that the
hoarding of gold is more harmful than beneficial?
To avoid a panic, the critics and seers say. But a
panic is not a mathematical problem; it is a psychological
problem. If mathematics could save us from
fear and madness we could then automatically ensure
general sanity and common sense. What mathematical
proportion will save us from a panic? Who is to
lay down the proportion? Where are we to draw
the magical line of safety? Is it to be an exact
proportion or an approximate proportion? Is it to
be an universally exact or universally approximate
proportion? Or is it to be an individually exact or
approximate proportion? There can be no exactitude,
particularly if we include the Bank of England. In
mathematics, however, we must have exactitude, for
half per cent below the formula might be fatal.
And if in order to keep up the proportion simultaneously
in Lombard Street and Threadneedle Street
lending ceases, then the crisis comes, despite the
proportion.</p>

<p>A psychological disease is not to be diagnosed by
the mathematician. We must find a psychological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
remedy for it, and that remedy is knowledge and
common sense. The nation that met the crisis in
August last so calmly and has faced since, resolutely
and philosophically, the most terrible ordeal of its
existence, is not likely to be seized with ungovernable
madness because we cannot get an exact mathematical
formula in dealing with bank reserves. The knowledge,
and the only knowledge that will keep them
sane and calm, is that banking is conducted soundly.
The confidence of the community is based, and justly
based, upon sound banking methods. So long as
banks transform into currency the best wealth, then
they are soundly managed, irrespective of mathematical
gold reserves. The best wealth is to be tested
by time—that is, by its durability. The highest wealth
is durable; the lowest wealth transient.</p>

<p>If we are to have no solid, lasting confidence in
sound banking, only in mathematical ratios, and if
the highest wealth the banks possess are to stand
them in no stead in a panic, then banks can reasonably
refuse to liquefy the best wealth. We could not
in that case blame them if they speculated. If they
maintain the mathematical inexact ratio laid down by
critics they will be mathematically safe, for sound
wealth in a panic will, the theorists say, be as worthless
as unsound wealth.</p>

<p>If banks are conducted soundly, if they perform
vital services to the nation, if the nation would stagnate
without those services, if the nation restricts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
their freedom of action by the provision of an inadequate
supply of legal tender and by the law of legal
tender, then it is the duty of the nation to help them
in that trouble for which they are not responsible. It
is also expedient for the nation to do this. It would
be conforming to the law of self-preservation. To do
otherwise would be national suicide.</p>

<p>Banks cannot do two contrary things at the self-same
moment. They cannot keep a high proportion
and in the same moment lend freely. If they lend
freely the proportion speedily falls, and might speedily
fall far below the mathematical formula of safety. If
they do not lend freely the mathematicians say they
will aggravate the crisis. The only sensible course
for the nation to take is to be its own physician. The
Government on its behalf can do again what it did
last year—provide a supplementary fund of legal
tender currency. This was effective more than half a
century ago, and it has been effective again. And
experience is of greater value than theory.</p>

<p>These, then, are some of the questions I discuss in
the following pages. I do not expect, of course, to
find common agreement. This would be presumption.
Nothing is more difficult than to destroy theories.
Experience is often impotent. Prophets are not
always silenced when their predictions are unrealized.
They continue to prophecy. They predicted confidently
that when the world-war came the financial
crisis would be far worse than the military crisis, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
that this country would be in the throes of a panic
the dimensions of which no human imagination could
conceive. Foreign countries with vast credits here
would take away every sovereign and every bar of
gold they could lay their hands on. Only those sovereigns
would remain that we had been far-sighted
enough to store in our back gardens, or, if we had no
back gardens, in our discarded stockings. Nothing of
this happened. There was no financial panic, no raid
upon our gold reserves. If there was any apprehension
it was mild and momentary, thanks to the
soundness of our banking system, the strength of our
financial structure, and the wisdom of our Government,
to say nothing of the soul of the nation. It was discovered
that, instead of other countries having it in
their power to take gold from us, they were so greatly
in our debt that they could not liquidate those debts,
and the exchanges went violently against them. Since
then gold has flowed into the country in unprecedented
amount, and there is still no sign of interruption
to the flow. This country is now overwhelmed
with gold. The reserves of the Bank of England and
of the joint stock banks continued to grow so rapidly
that loans, or “credits” as they are called, glutted
the market. Banks lent with difficulty even on
nominal terms. So far from predictions being fulfilled,
that has come to pass never dreamt of in the
wildest of dreams—a land towards which, in the midst
of war, the golden river was flowing, fed by tributary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
streams, and undiminished in volume by huge purchases
of warlike stores and material from neutral
countries.</p>

<p>The country was saved by wisdom—by the wisdom
of the people and by the wisdom of the Government
which promptly acted on the wisest advice. This
begot confidence and strengthened faith. It was calm
confidence and serene faith in intellectual ability that
enabled the country to go through the crisis with
success and that evoked the profound gratitude
of all.</p>

<p>Confidence, the energizing, vitalizing spirit of
economic progress is distinct from what is called
Lombard Street credit. Yet both connote a confiding
in or a believing in something. In what? Confidence
is fundamentally a confiding in the greatness of the
nation. There can be no confidence in the littleness
of a nation.</p>

<p>The financial writer would probably be discharged
who wrote in his money article: “Confidence in
Lombard Street yesterday was in superabundant
supply, and sellers could find no borrowers of it even
on nominal terms. In fact, before the close of business
balances of confidence were unplaceable. Overnight
confidence fetched no more than 1 per cent.
and weekly confidences 1½ per cent. In consequence,
therefore, of this great mass and weight of confidence
the discount market was very weak and rates fell
further. It is thought probable that the Bank of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
England may have to make confidence scarcer and
dearer by taking it off the market, that is to say, by
borrowing confidence.”</p>

<p>Is, therefore, that superstructure of “credit” that
superstructure of confidence beneath which the
country economically prospers? Is there not often
in Lombard Street an abundance of “credit” coincident
with a scarcity of confidence? And is not all
this “credit” impotent without confidence? Is prostrate
confidence to obtain its re-creative power only
from mountainous gold reserves? Or will it be regenerated
by a new faith in the essential greatness
and wealth of the country?</p>

<p>I have great hopes of the future. I give abundant
reasons for this faith within me. Experience has
taught me the incalculable harm pessimism does.
Pessimism is like an infectious disease. It spreads
quickly. It is difficult to fight against it. There are
numerous sad-visaged prophets amongst us to-day—men
without hope, men without a smile. They
cannot cheer us. They see coming, with the inevitability
and irresistibility of doom, the day of sorrow,
the day when we shall reap the abundant aftermath
of woe. But dark as the night may be, I see a new
day of joy dawning, a day when the sowers will go
forth with renewed hope and energy, with the confidence
that they will gather in at the due season a
harvest more abundant than they have reaped before.
Let us not wring our hands and moan in dark corners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
Let us look forward with brave hearts and strong
minds to the day of victory and peace. That day will
bring us a new faith, a new confidence, perhaps a new
happiness in which we shall forget the old griefs and
despairs.</p>

OUR FINANCIAL FABRIC</span></h2>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Treatises</span> innumerable have been written about
money. Famous and non-famous political economists
have attempted a definition of money. These definitions
have been divergent, and often irreconcilable.
Political economists have found it no easier to arrive
at a simple, understandable, explicit formula than
literary critics have found it to define poetry. All
of us have a vague idea of what money is, but it is
so vague that it is well-nigh impossible to present it
in a concise and precise phrase.</p>

<p>This amazes the man in the street, who believes
that nothing is so simple, nothing so easily conceivable
as money. To him, of course, money
consists of so many pounds, shillings, and pence,
and when that is said, all is said. What more is
there to explain and define? He is wealthy or
poor, comfortable or miserable, according to the
quantity of pounds, shillings, and pence he possesses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
He knows that he can satisfy his needs, his desires,
his cravings if he has enough money with which to
buy what he wants, but if he has insufficient his
needs and longings will not be gratified.</p>

<p>He knows that when he goes into a shop he
exchanges money for commodities. When he purchases
a pair of boots he does not tender for them
a watch, or loaves, or a couple of tender chickens
that he has bred on his poultry farm. He hands
over a few shillings, receives the boots neatly packed,
thanks the shopman, says “Good-day,” and is quite
unconscious that he really has exchanged for the
boots commodities that he or some other members
of the community have produced.</p>

<p>It would be waste of time and labour, in a
treatise of this character, to devote several chapters
to the evolution of money, or, rather, to the evolution
of those articles that have served the usages
of exchange. Those who desire to acquaint themselves
with these historical facts must consult the
many works devoted thereto. The world’s monetary
systems, at the stage now reached by them—it does
not follow that it is a final stage—are the outcome
of experiments and improvements in national and
international exchange. In primitive days direct
barter was resorted to. Goods were exchanged
directly for goods, commodities for commodities.
The baker took his bread to the tailor when he was
in need of a garment, and the maker of footwear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
took his handiwork to the baker or the butcher when
he wanted food.</p>

<p>This worked well enough in small communities
living in circumscribed areas, having no intercourse
with communities living at inaccessible distances.
But as the communities grew, as their boundaries
expanded, as they came into closer touch with other
communities, as distance became shortened by the
discoveries of means of transport, as individual and
collective mentality strengthened, these primitive
communities had to face the increasing inconveniences
of direct barter. Necessity stimulated
ingenuity and invention until in the course of ages
the inconveniences were lessened by the use of
selected articles for exchange. These were selected
partly because of their scarcity and partly because
of their durability, for it was discovered that scarce
things were prized more highly than things that
were abundant.</p>

<p>That which was scarce, therefore, by being more
highly prized became what we call more valuable.
That is to say, more store was set by its possession.
The possession of it excited admiration and envy
and greed; admiration and envy are the bases of
economic value to this day. They are not the bases
of ethical value, but economic law and moral law are
opposed in many directions.</p>

<p>Scarce things, therefore, were just as much
prized by primitive people as they are prized by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
civilized people to-day. It was these scarce things,
therefore, that could be exchanged for an abundance
of things, because no one valued what could easily
be got and what all could have. There was a time
when iron was scarce. As iron, too, was most useful
for a great variety of purposes and as its utility was
constantly showing itself, its scarcity, added to its
usefulness, made it increasingly prized and valued.
A ring of iron for a crown was of greater worth once
than are the diamond-studded crowns of present day
monarchs, and iron was at one time scarcer than
diamonds and rubies are now, and a man in
possession of a little iron could exchange that
possession for a great quantity of cattle with the
man who had more cattle than he knew what to
do with. Cattle, therefore, were what we call cheap
and iron was dear, the primitive idea being, as it still
is, that cheapness consists in much and dearness in
little, irrespective of their values in preserving life.</p>

<p>Iron was dear because it was scarce, cattle were
cheap because they were plentiful. But man cannot
live by iron, though he can live on cattle. Judged,
therefore, from the standpoint of life-preservation,
cattle should be more precious than iron; but judged
from the standpoint of envy and vanity, iron was,
as gold now is, of greater value than cattle. The
one preserves life, the other pride, and here we
see some components of the foundation on which
the economic fabric has been reared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>A savage with a little iron and no live stock was
considered wealthier and more enviable than the
man with no iron and a vast quantity of live stock.
The man in possession of the iron knew that he
could get as much live stock as he wanted by parting
with all or only a portion of his iron, and when he
exchanged a portion of his iron for cattle he actually
parted with money. The iron and the cattle were
money—the iron was the sovereign and the cattle
the pence in those days.</p>

<p>Now, the iron being scarce and being highly
valued by the community on whose land it was
found, a greater value was conferred upon it in time
by law. The king and his counsellors of those days
enacted that a certain quantity of iron should discharge
so much taxes or redeem so much debt, that
the Government would accept it in payment of
taxes and in liquidation of debt, thereby absolving
the payer from all legal responsibilities and penalties.
From being merely an instrument of custom iron
was raised to the higher function of being a legal
instrument. It was given a certain arbitrary value,
the value being expressed in the amount of taxes
it should represent and in the amount of debt it
should legally discharge.</p>

<p>Great importance lies in the conception that
the legal, apart from the custom value, was purely
arbitrary.</p>

<p>Cattle would be accepted in payment of taxes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
in discharge of debt also; but, being more plentiful,
and therefore of less value, the Government decreed
that so many cattle would be equivalent to so many
pounds of iron. Those who had no iron, therefore,
had to pay in cattle, just as in these times those who
have no gold must pay in silver or bronze.</p>

<p>Although a diamond may be worth many
sovereigns, it will not be accepted by the tax
collector, nor by our creditors, because it has
no legal value. That is to say, it is not a legal
instrument.</p>

<p>We are beginning to have some glimmering now
of what money is. Money performs two important
functions. It is a medium of exchange and it is a
standard of value.</p>

<p>Money was the instrument man invented, after
mental travail, to lessen or remove the inconveniences
of direct barter.</p>

<p>Money represents the possession of a claim on
the products of the community. It is a present and
a future claim upon a portion of the wealth of the
general community. When the claim is exercised it
performs its function of a medium of exchange.</p>

<p>The idea is this. We are all potential consumers
and producers. We have read of the early Christian
community, when all the members of that community
brought their goods and possessions to the common
store and divided equally. This is precisely how
society lives to-day. We all bring our goods and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
possessions to the common store, or market, as it is
called, and there they are divided. But they are
not divided equally. This is the chief difference.
They are divided unequally in accord with our
notions of equitable distribution.</p>

<p>Our claims on the common wealth are supposed
to be based justly upon our individual produce. The
more we produce the more we claim, the less we
produce the less we claim. This is the fundamental
idea, or hypothesis; but, like many ideas or hypotheses,
the practical working of it is far from just
and perfect. But the fundamental idea will make
clear the function money performs.</p>

<p>We are familiar with those schemes of relief in
times of distress when tickets are given to the poor,
representing a certain quantity of food. On presentation
to the butcher the ticket is exchanged for a
pound of meat, and on presentation to the baker it
is exchanged for a quartern loaf. These tickets are
money. They are a media of exchange and possess
exchange value. They are claims on the butcher or
baker. If the possessor chooses, he can exchange
the ticket with another for a pint of ale, and the
other can claim the meat or the bread. They can
pass from hand to hand, become currency, as money
is called, and the exchange can be effected immediately
or deferred.</p>

<p>The meat and the bread are subsequently paid
for out of another fund, and the butcher and baker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
hand over the tickets and are paid their respective
portions out of this common fund.</p>

<p>Now, the Government of the land can proclaim,
if it pleases, that these tickets can represent permanent
claims on the community. Instead of being
destroyed, they can be used over and over again for
an indefinite period—be made what is called legal
currency.</p>

<p>What the laws have done is to decree that gold,
silver, copper, and paper shall represent our claims
on a certain proportion of the nation’s wealth. When
we take our products to market we exchange them
for these claims. These claims we afterwards present
to the butcher, baker, and tailor, and when we have
got rid of them we have exhausted our claims on
them. If we can get no further claims we become
poor or destitute. The only means of getting fresh
claims is to bring more wealth to market and
exchange it for more claims, and according to the
quantity and quality of that wealth, so are the claims
we get greater or smaller. The greater our claims
the richer we are, the smaller our claims the poorer
we are. If we bring to market products that no one
wants and people will not exchange part of their
claims for our merchandise, then we know our labour
has been in vain.</p>

<p>In order to live, we must obtain these legal claims
on the general wealth, and if we cannot obtain them
we starve or become parasites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>A distinction exists, and a most important distinction,
between money and legal tender currency.
Anything may be money. If I have no legal tender
currency and only a gold watch and I am in great
need of a dress suit and I offer the watch for the
suit and the watch is taken, that watch is money.
It is no one else’s concern if the tailor accepts the
watch in exchange for his labour, his skill, and his
cloth. He has liberty to exchange the dress suit, if
he pleases, for some ancient ornament he desires to
possess, instead of for legal coin or currency. But
he knows that the ornament will satisfy only his
desire, and will be no claim on any portion of the
community’s wealth. The butcher will not accept
it for meat. But it has performed the function of
money nevertheless.</p>

<p>The law has decreed, however, that there shall
be a species of money, or currency, that shall have
permanent value as a medium of exchange. It has
decreed that all must accept this in exchange for
wealth and in discharge of all legal obligations.
With this object in view it has chosen gold to be
the legal claim, and has set up gold to be what is
called a standard of value. Treatises have been
written on standards and on values. Both are
highly controversial subjects, but these controversies
must be ignored here.</p>

<p>This standard, or unit of value, is called in Great
Britain a sovereign. It was decreed that this coin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
should consist of an arbitrary quantity of gold, mixed
with alloy, and that it should be stamped with
certain designs. These designs alone make it legal
money, or legal tender. If I had a coin, containing
exactly as much gold as a sovereign, and worth
exactly as much, but plain, with no design, it would
not be a legal coin. It would not be accepted in
discharge of debt, in payment of taxes, in exchange
for wealth. I could, perhaps, sell it to the jeweller
for something below its real value, because he could
make use of the metal to advantage; but it would be
useless to buy meat and bread with.</p>

<p>The law, therefore, has decreed that a coin
composed of gold, of a certain weight, and with
certain designs upon it shall be a legal unit of value,
and that so much silver and so much bronze shall
be equal in value to this unit. It has decreed that
sovereigns shall be legal tender for liabilities to an
illimitable amount, that silver shall be legal tender
to the maximum equality of £2, and bronze to the
maximum equality of one shilling. That is to say,
a creditor, if he chooses, can demand gold in redemption
of his debt beyond £2, but whether he
will put the demand into execution or not depends
upon his will or circumstances.</p>

<p>It is necessary, therefore, to lay emphasis upon
this distinction between money and legal tender
currency. Money is relative wealth, because it
represents relative, temporary claims; but legal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
tender currency is absolute wealth because it represents
absolute, permanent claims.</p>

<p>If Germany conquered this country and enacted
that the sovereign should no longer be legal currency,
and that the mark should be substituted for it, the
sovereign would then become a commodity, worth only
its value in gold. Sovereigns are commodities abroad,
just as continental gold units are commodities here.
Sovereigns have no legal value on the Continent.
Francs, marks, and dollars have no legal value in this
country. What, in each country, confers upon the
commodity gold its legal function as money is legislative
enactment. Legislative enactment can also make
a comparatively worthless product like paper of much
greater value than gold. The paper value of a
note for £100 is trifling. But because the Government
has decreed it shall be worth one hundred
sovereigns, then the individual members of the
community take it at its face value. What is its
value in Germany, especially when we are at war
with Germany?</p>

<p>This shows the great and arbitrary power the
Government of a nation possesses.</p>

<p>It can make stones legal tender if it chooses. Or
it can make diamonds legal tender. Many nations
have made silver and not gold legal tender.</p>

<p>When individuals of a nation exchange commodities
they exchange it as in national legal tender.
There is, however, no international legal tender.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
When nations exchange commodities the payment is
made in different instruments, such as bills of
exchange. Whenever gold is exchanged it is exchanged
solely as a monetary commodity, and not in
its national legal character as money. The gold in
the sovereign is valued according to its quantity, and
not by its value as a legal instrument, token or
claim. But it is rarely that gold passes from one
country to another in payment for goods received.
This payment is managed in a much easier and less
expensive fashion.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHAT IS MARKET MONEY?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">What</span> is the money that is bought and sold in the
money market? Who are the merchants there?
Who are the middlemen? Who are the sellers and
buyers? What sort of a place is this money market?
We can visualize a cattle market, where farmers
bring their cattle to sell, and we can visualize Covent
Garden, where fruit, vegetables, and flowers are sold:
but can we visualize a money market? Is it in some
vast building in the City? Is Lombard Street a
mighty emporium where many merchants congregate
at their stalls and offer, in the same fashion as
vendors of apples and sweets do, pounds, shillings,
and pence for sale?</p>

<p>It is not located in any spacious building, like the
London Stock Exchange. Buyers do not go there
and offer golden sovereigns for golden sovereigns and
silver shillings for silver shillings. To the ordinary
man, who is perplexed by the mysteries of the money
market, it sounds strange, indeed, that money can be
bought with money. This is because he associates
money with pounds, shillings, and pence, and cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
understand a sovereign being bought with a sovereign.
Yet he understands the business of a money-lender
and he understands borrowing. He knows that when
he borrows from a money-lender he borrows money
and pays something for the loan, something that
he calls interest. Well, the vendors of money in
Lombard Street are purely and simply money-lenders
on a great scale.</p>

<p>Banks are wholesale business houses where money
is made, and where money is sold. The selling is
not, however, on all fours with apple selling. When
we sell apples we part with the apples for good. We
do not lend them for a definite period to the buyer,
and the buyer does not return them at the end of
that period. In buying and selling apples an absolute
exchange is made, money and fruit being
definitely parted with.</p>

<p>In the money market the merchandise of the
merchants is not exchanged in this absolute fashion,
so that, in the literal connotation of the word,
Lombard Street is not a market.</p>

<p>Lombard Street is an organism, essential to the
vitality, health, and welfare of the body politic, as the
heart and the lungs are necessary to the complete
life-preservation of the human body. The nation
could, of course, live without Lombard Street. But
without it, it would be a corpse-like, moribund life in
comparison with the vitality and energy imparted to
it by this economic organism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>In Lombard Street money is made. What kind
of money? Some strongly insist that no money is
made, but only what is called credit. This, too, is
a highly controversial subject, on which divergent
views are held and are likely to be held.</p>

<p>Instead of hoarding our money, placing our
golden sovereigns in bags and old tea-pots, and
burying them in our cellars, we have reached that
stage in our economic development when we place
them in the keeping of banks. We have several
purposes in view in doing this. We place money in
the keeping of the banks for absolute safety; we
place it there for convenience; and we place it there
to earn what we call interest on it. Hoarding, we
are intelligent enough to know, would be unsafe,
inconvenient, and unprofitable.</p>

<p>Yet we really obey the instinct of hoarding when
we place our savings and surplus money in the
keeping of banks. But we have a secondary motive
in this action which we will call greed or avarice.
We desire our hoards to be fruitful. It is like placing
seed in the ground from which to gather future
harvests.</p>

<p>But the banks do not hoard our money. If we
think they do we labour under a delusion. They
employ it in various ways. They lend it to a variety
of borrowers at interest, they invest it in all kinds of
securities and property, and earn interest on it by
this varied employment. Out of this interest they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
maintain their vast and expensive establishments,
pay the salaries to their servants, and pay the
interest on the money we, as individuals, place in
their keeping.</p>

<p>The position might be illustrated in a simple way.
I have saved up two hundred pounds. These two
hundred sovereigns I place on deposit at the bank,
and am allowed, say, 2½ per cent. interest. I prefer
the small interest because I believe the principal
will be safe always, safer than if invested in any
security or property. Moreover, I know that I can
draw this money out whenever I please, but were it
locked up in some security or mortgage, I should not
feel sure of getting possession of it again in a
moment of need. But the bank, lawfully, must
return me intact the two hundred sovereigns when I
ask for it.</p>

<p>Now the bank re-lends this £200 at, say, 4 per
cent. interest, making a profit of 1½ per cent. interest.
Out of this interest it must pay salaries,
rent, and all working expenses. How can it do it?</p>

<p>It doesn’t do it, and it couldn’t do it. No such
miracle could be done. This £200 is multiplied
greatly. The bank can make that £200 into £1000
or £2000, and actually lend £2000. If I went one
day to ask for the £200, the bank might tell me
it could let me have only £10 or £20, and if I
insisted on having the £200, it might have to close
its doors and go into the bankruptcy court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>How is this £200 made into a fund of £2000?
Do the sovereigns actually multiply in the bank’s
coffers? Is there a bank fairy that can make
sovereigns out of nothing? No. There is no bank
fairy, and no sovereigns are multiplied. Yet the
bank says it has £2000 to lend, and lends £2000.</p>

<p>That which it lends over and above the original
sum of £200 is said to be the bank’s credit. The
bank is said, in the terminology of the money
market, to create credit to this extent. It keeps,
say, ten or twenty sovereigns in its till to provide
for the emergencies of a sudden demand, and
lends the rest of the gold and something beyond it.
This something else is called credit. Some people
say it is to all intents and purposes actually money;
others declare it is not. And in discussions on this
subject a lot of anger has been wasted and more
vanity wounded.</p>

<p>Anyway, whether we call it money or whether we
call it credit, the fact is indisputable that this is the
tangible or intangible something with which banks
benefit the trade and commerce of the nation, and
help us all to become wealthier. This is the so-called
money of Lombard Street.</p>

<p>They risk, however, grave dangers, and the community
risks grave dangers in setting up this
machinery to facilitate and smooth national and
international commercial dealings. These dangers
will be unfolded gradually in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>Already it has been hinted where one danger
lies.</p>

<p>If of that £200 I place £100 on deposit and £100
on current account at the bank, the bank has still
a total of 200 sovereigns, and can multiply this sum
into £1000 or £2000. But it pays interest then only
on half the sum—the sum on deposit. On the other
half it pays no interest, but it can lend the whole.
If I desire to withdraw the £200, I can by law draw
half on demand. The bank, however, can insist on
some days’ notice before allowing me to withdraw
the amount on deposit. But if I insisted on having
£100 and the bank had only £20 and could not get
the other £80 quickly, it might have to close its doors.
This would be a run on the bank that might bring it
to ruin.</p>

<p>The bank hopes, of course, that I shall not
demand my money in a lump sum at a moment’s
notice; that there will be no run. It also hopes
that if I do demand it, it will at once demand the
return of its loan, or part of its loan, from those who
have borrowed from it, and thereby get the two
hundred sovereigns it owes to me. It will then be in
a position of having still on loan money, or credit,
based apparently on no gold.</p>

<p>If it is not based on gold, it is based, however, on
some kind of wealth. Those who have borrowed
from the bank leave securities, Consols, say, as collateral
for the loan. If they do not repay the loan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the bank has the securities, which it can sell in the
market for cash.</p>

<p>If it has no gold, it has something it can exchange
for gold.</p>

<p>It now becomes a little clearer that what the
bank has actually done is not to create £1800 out of
nothing, but to liquefy £1800 of the nation’s wealth.
Is this process of liquefaction granting credit or
creating currency? It looks more like a creation of
currency than a creation of credit. If the bank lent
without security, then it could with greater logic and
reason be called a creation of credit. But it does not
so lend.</p>

<p>If gold is wealth and Consols are wealth, then it
lends wealth, whether it lends gold or Consols.
Therefore, what the banks apparently do is to lend
one man’s wealth to another man, taking a commission
from the borrower for the services rendered.
If Consols were made legal tender, like sovereigns,
we should not say that lending Consols was creating
credit.</p>

<p>Selling Consols in the market is not creating
credit. The selling of Consols to a banker for a consideration
is not different essentially from selling
them in the market. The borrower virtually sells
them to the banker, and so long as the banker holds
them he is not creating credit.</p>

<p>If a man hands over to me his mansion for a
loan, that mansion is mine till he repays the loan.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
He has sold it to me temporarily. By lending him
the money I possess I do not lend him credit. I may
part with all my money, but I have the mansion,
which I can sell for money. If I cannot sell it, I may
lose much. But that will depend upon my wisdom
and foresight. I, at least, have something of some
value in the shape of the mansion.</p>

<p>It is so with banks. Their security depends upon
the nature of the wealth they liquefy. If it be the
best wealth their security is sounder than if it be
the worst wealth. It is not necessary, and it should
certainly never be necessary, in the real interests
of the community, to liquefy only one kind of
wealth.</p>

<p>Banking security should rest, therefore, chiefly
upon the highest wealth of the nation and not solely,
as some contend, upon that limited species called
legal tender. This aspect of the problem will be
elaborated in later chapters.</p>

<p>Let us take another look at our modest current
account. We draw cheques against this current
account. We pay our income tax, our rent, our
tradesmen, with these cheques. The cheques are
accepted readily and unquestionably by all. Why?
Because the cheques, the paper, have intrinsic value?
No. But because they have trust in our <em>best</em> banks
and trust in our possession of the money in these
banks. A cheque on the <em>worst</em> banks would not be
so readily accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>But we all know that the sovereigns are not
actually there. Does the drawing of a cheque create
credit? Or is the drawing of a cheque merely the
evidence that we actually have what we profess to
have? In drawing a cheque we do what the banks
do when they grant a loan. When we pay for a suit
with a cheque we receive the suit in exchange. When
a banker draws a cheque and receives Consols or
bills of discount, he really buys the Consols and
buys the bills. But some contend that he buys the
Consols with nothing. So it can be contended that
we bought our suit with nothing in the event of the
bank smashing.</p>

<p>The cheques we draw become currency, become,
in the essential meaning of the word, money. They
are not legal tender; but legal tender is only a
small portion of the nation’s currency, that portion
arbitrarily selected by the legislature for a specific,
but important purpose.</p>

<p>That that selection is wise is a view not unanimously
held by economic thinkers.</p>

<p>But it is a selection that must control the policy
of bank management to a paramount extent. This
does not exclude, however, the scope and expediency
of legislative reform.</p>

<p>We cannot draw cheques against our deposit
accounts. But though we can withdraw these deposits
the bank can insist, as I have said, on certain
notice. This notice, however, is never insisted upon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
It would be injudicious to insist upon it. It would
be injudicious because it would give rise to the
suspicion that the bank was unsoundly managed and
in a bad way. And suspicion is the surest way
towards the destruction of a bank.</p>

<p>On the liability side the capital issued is the
amount paid up by shareholders, capital which the
bank has employed in the ordinary course of its
business. It represents a contingent liability to
these shareholders, who have invested their capital
for the sake of the return in the shape of dividends.
The large sum of thirty-seven and a half millions is
the most important item. This is the real working
capital of the bank. It is apparently the aggregate
amount deposited by the public with the bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>This is what the bank owes to its clientele.</p>

<p>But the deposits are not solely money actually
placed with the bank. This huge sum includes the
loans the bank has made to other customers, to its
borrowers. Every loan makes an additional deposit.
The man who borrows a sum of money from the
bank is credited with that sum and the credit appears
in the current accounts. The bank has security for
this loan, and, as already pointed out, this security
is liquefied into bank currency. Cheques can at
once be drawn against it so long as the loan runs
and cheques are the country’s currency. Securities,
therefore, have been converted into national currency
and indirectly into legal tender.</p>

<p>The more, therefore, a bank lends the more do
its deposit and current accounts grow.</p>

<p>The reserve fund speaks for itself. It is generally
a fund accumulated annually out of profits and
invested in the best securities. The larger the
reserve in proportion to the capital and business
the stronger is the bank’s position. It is a provision
against future contingencies and is not touched
except for these contingencies. One purpose is to
meet depreciation in investments or other losses.
The money being invested in the highest securities
these can be sold for cash whenever the need for
it arises.</p>

<p>The acceptances on behalf of customers are
also practically covered by securities deposited by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
customers, until they lodge the funds to meet the
bank’s liabilities in this direction. The net profit
is the fund due to the shareholders of the bank, who
receive their dividends therefrom.</p>

<p>On the asset side, the cash in hand and at the
Bank of England consists of coin and notes. A
portion of this is in the tills and safes of the bank
in order to meet the ordinary daily needs, the incomings
and outgoings, while the rest is money
deposited with the Bank of England in precisely the
same way as an individual deposits money with a
joint stock bank. It serves two purposes. It
composes an additional reserve there in legal tender,
and facilitates the clearings between the various
banks, debits and credits being daily adjusted in the
books of the Bank of England.</p>

<p>It is contended by many that the banks do not
keep reserves large enough in proportion to their
liabilities—reserves, that is to say, in actual legal
tender. It is contended that they trade on too slight
a margin of gold, or legal tender; but this question
must be threshed out when the way has been
cleared for it.</p>

<p>The next item is the money at call and short
notice. This is practically the money lent by the
banks to money brokers, stock brokers, and discount
houses. Money at call practically means that the
bulk of it is lent from day to day and that banks
can demand its repayment at a moment’s notice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
The money is also borrowed on security, so that
while the banks owe the money to the borrowers
and the borrowers owe the money to the banks, the
banks have the securities. These securities thereby
become currency. They can also become currency
if the public will accept them as currency, but the
public prefers cheques to securities. The greater
convenience of cheques need not, of course, be
emphasized.</p>

<p>It will be seen that a bank’s “investments” are
a large sum. They include the reserve fund, and the
bank’s annual income is, of course, swollen by the
interest it receives on these investments, in the same
way as an individual’s income is increased. These
investments are of the very highest class and
strengthen the assets the bank possesses against
its liabilities on deposits. It is presumed, of course,
that they can be readily sold for cash should the
need for the conversion arise.</p>

<p>Bills discounted reveal the character of another
source of income. They represent investments in
another high-class security. A few bills may be
discounted directly on behalf of customers, but the
bulk are bills re-discounted from the discount houses.
Bill brokers discount bills at a certain price and the
banks re-discount them at a lower price, and both,
therefore, make a good aggregate profit out of the
business. Bill brokers are practically the middlemen
between merchants and the banks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p>These bills of discount being an investment and
a sound security are thereby liquefied into ordinary
currency and ordinary capital, capital which the
merchant is able to use in the ordinary course of his
business, while the nation at large benefits from the
increased capital employed and the greater production
and consumption that are the immediate
fruits of it.</p>

<p>The largest item on the asset side is the composite
one of “loans, advances, other accounts and
securities.” These include customers’ overdrafts and
advances to customers on all kinds of security and
estate, and may, perhaps, be regarded as the least
liquid or the least readily realizable assets a bank
has. In this item are its chief risks, and, perhaps,
the soundness of banking is best judged by the size
of this account. The larger the size the greater,
presumably, are the risks; the smaller the size the
less are the risks.</p>

<p>But the aggregate forms a portion of the wealth
of the community. A customer gives some kind of
security when he overdraws his account. But all
this composite wealth, of whatever class its component
elements may be, is, by the machinery of the
bank, converted into currency. These loans amount
to nearly half the liabilities on deposit and current
accounts, therefore additional currency to this amount
can be placed in circulation. If no banks lent on
such wealth there would be less potential capital in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
circulation; the capital would be as stationary and
as unfruitful as hoarded coin. While, therefore, the
bank owes this sum to the borrowers, giving them
power to draw cheques against it or to take out the
whole sum in cash, the borrowers owe the money to
the bank; for the loans interest has, of course, to be
paid according to the class of security lodged. This
interest is one of the chief sources of a bank’s
income.</p>

<p>The liabilities of customers for acceptances has
been explained. They offset the item on the liability
side. They may be regarded as a moderate source
of a bank’s income, and this class of business has to
be done with great care. As for the bank’s premises,
this is its own property in which it must do its
business, and it is self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Having analysed a typical bank balance sheet,
we are able to see the kind of business a bank conducts
and the valuable functions it performs on
behalf of the community. A bank is in reality a
manufacturer of currency—not of legal tender currency,
but the currency of custom. The Government
does not provide this necessary machinery, so the
banks provide it, and we can imagine what would
happen to the country if the machinery broke down,
or if it were compulsorily stopped.</p>

<p>This custom currency has become so much an
integral part of the economic and financial structure
of the country, that even our tax-gatherers will accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
a cheque as readily as sovereigns. Our currency is
to all intents and purposes a paper currency, the
soundness of which is rarely questioned. It is not
legal tender currency, but it is as vital to the well-being
of the nation as legal tender currency.</p>

<p>The other paper currency is Bank of England
notes and, since the war, Treasury £1 and 10<i>s.</i> notes.
Even though the whole of these notes may not be
convertible into cash, they are legal tender simply and
solely because the legislature has enacted that they
shall be legal tender. This is, of course, something
outside custom. If the legislature were pleased to
do so, it could enact that cheques on certain specified
banks should be legal tender, just as it arbitrarily
enacted that the new Treasury notes, issued without
any gold backing at first, should be legal tender,
equal to the amount of their face value in gold.</p>

<p>I wish to emphasize the distinction, therefore,
between the currency of custom—something that has
grown up out of the needs of the community, something
essential to its welfare and progress, the product
of an advanced stage of economics and of civilization—and
the currency called legal tender. Though debts
are paid and are payable in custom currency, the
power of this currency to redeem debt could be
destroyed in certain circumstances, the circumstances
of a panic. They may be remote circumstances, but,
remote as they are, they raise deep problems which
to this day are discussed with energy and heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>Ought the Government to provide machinery
more adequate than that it does provide to meet the
currency needs of the nation? This is one aspect of
the problem. Some say it ought to provide it, some
say this does not come within its province. It is left
to the banks to provide that currency as best they
may and quite apart from their methods of providing
it, it is indisputable that they administer to a vital
economic need. If, therefore, they administer to
that need, should the Government come to their
assistance in those circumstances which cause a
collapse of their machinery?</p>

<p>This question has been answered in part by the
Government since the outbreak of the war. It helped
the machinery to work, and provided against a possible
collapse by issuing “emergency” currency
notes. The Government having acknowledged an
emergency and established a precedent, the problem
is now much simplified.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV"><span id="toclink_32"></span>CHAPTER IV<br>

<span class="subhead">CREDIT AND CONFIDENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Credit,</span> which banks are said to create, has several
connotations. It has a social, an ethical, and a
financial connotation, and it is necessary to examine
awhile these connotations. From the derivation, or
original conception of the word, or idea, it is an
expression of belief or trust, as distinct from disbelief
and distrust.</p>

<p>In the social world, when we say a person stands
in high credit, what is it we imply? That he is a
rich man, a man of great wealth? By no means.
He may be a poor man, that is to say poor relatively
to the position he occupies. In the social sphere he
can carry considerable weight even though he may
be dishonest, dishonourable and immoral. We ignore
his vices, yet hold him in high esteem. His credit
is based less on his character than on our snobbery.
We bow before title and caste, irrespective of the
merits of the individual. A lord of bad character
will be more sought after, receive more flattery and
deference, than a no-titled man of noble character.
If we were not snobbish we should despise him as he
deserves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>From this springs the desire of men to gain title,
no matter what means and methods they employ to
this end. They know that a title in some potent
way aggrandizes them, and they can enter an
assembly with greater assurance and confidence and
pomposity than they could if their names were still
as plain as in their humble days.</p>

<p>The conferring of a title is not necessarily a
recognition of high moral worth. But a title can
be a national recognition of intellectual merits, or
ability. The credit of those who receive this distinction
is strengthened. We have greater confidence
than before in their intellectual ability and power.
We have deeper trust in their wisdom and sagacity
and in their counsel. We have the less hesitation in
following their guidance in those paths with which
they are presumed to be intimately familiar. In this
greater, but still restricted, knowledge of theirs we
repose our trust.</p>

<p>We know that moral credit is distinct from this.
It is based upon character solely, irrespective of
social position or means. A poor man may be a
man of high nobility. We may despise his poverty,
but we honour his spirit. We are conscious that he
is far beyond us, that we cannot reach the moral
plane upon which he stands. He is a man in whose
honesty, integrity, and conscientiousness we would
place unquestioning trust. We know that in no
circumstances would he disabuse that trust. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
know that he would have the moral power to resist
all temptation.</p>

<p>Such a man may have great strength of character,
high moral worth, but he may be weak intellectually.
He may be no scholar, no man of erudition, no man
of imagination, and possess no exceptional ability.
His intellectual limitations may be the cause of his
poverty. But in whatever position he may be placed,
according to his limited qualifications, we know that
he will discharge his duties faithfully, conscientiously,
to the best of his ability, and will not swerve a
moment from the path of honesty and uprightness.
Such a man could be no thief and could tell no lie.</p>

<p>He lessens our anxieties. We say we can trust
him as readily and as confidently as we can trust
ourselves. It is a matter for thankfulness that we
have such a servant in whom we can place our
trust.</p>

<p>Here, therefore, are illustrations of intellectual
and moral credit which men are said to possess.</p>

<p>Financial credit is another kind of credit. With
this, perhaps, mankind is more familiar. The
economic standing and welfare, as distinct from the
purely moral standing, of a nation is dependent upon
what we call financial credit. If I lend money to a
friend it is immaterial to me what his abilities or his
morals may be, so long as I know he will be in a
position to repay that loan. If his moral credit be
bad, he will, perhaps, not repay it if he has the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
means; but even if his moral credit be bad he may
pay it from motives of expediency. He may want a
further loan later, and it would not be to his material
interests for me to propagate the fact that he will not
repay his debts. His credit is worth too much to
him to be placed in jeopardy of this kind. He must
redeem the debt if only from the business motive of
expediency.</p>

<p>Tradesmen are said to live on credit. They
declare that if they refused to grant credit to their
customers they would speedily be in the bankruptcy
court. By granting such credit they run grave
risks. They have to trust to the honesty of their
customers and to their future means. Therefore
they have to face the risks of incurring losses by bad
debts, phenomena inseparable from such business.
On the other hand, they believe that by granting
such credit and running such risks they extend their
custom and compete with hopes of greater success
against their rivals. What they may lose in the way
of bad debts they may more than recoup in the
larger profits they make on the growth of their
business.</p>

<p>It may be, from an ethical standpoint, a degrading
and deplorable way of living on each other
in a highly civilized community, but the fact serves
the purpose of illustrating our ideas of financial credit.</p>

<p>We have to live by trusting in each other,
trusting in each other’s financial means and financial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
honesty. A man may be highly moral and respectable
in his life, a worthy husband, father and citizen,
an able and faithful servant, thoroughly trustworthy,
yet may be mean and financially dishonest. Or he
may be the victim of misfortune and cannot redeem
his debts to the tradesman and others even if he
would.</p>

<p>Looking more closely into the credit on which a
tradesman relies we find it altogether different from the
credit which, it is declared, banks create and prosper
on. We can, perhaps, contend that a tradesman
lends cheese, butter, and eggs, in the hope that he
will be paid for them eventually.</p>

<p>I am the customer. I ask him to let me have
cheese, butter, and eggs for a month, and I will pay
for them at the end of the month. Were I a
stranger to him he might demur. But if he has
known me for years and knows that I am a man of
my word, a man to be trusted, he will gladly let me
have the goods on the credit of the reputation I
hold with him.</p>

<p>What is the tradesman’s security? Simply my
word and my reputation. Simply his trust in me. I
do not leave with him my watch, my securities, or my
works on political economy. If, however, I failed to
pay for the goods I received of him and had left
some of my valuable possessions with him, he could
sell these possessions in the market, and indirectly
be paid for his goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>If he were indirectly paid for them, would he be
granting me credit? He would certainly not be
granting that kind of credit which the man in the
street understands as credit. Political economists
and financiers may be distinct from men in the
street, but the simple-minded, the man unversed
in the theories of political economy, would see
no difference between this and barter. In fact, it
looks exactly like the barter so beautifully and
so fascinatingly described in primers on political
economy. However, we do not pledge our watches
with the grocer for eggs and bacon. We pledge our
words and our character only, and at the end of the
month we hand him over a cheque, the national
currency, and once more demonstrate to him the
value of <em>our</em> credit, not <em>his</em>.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is now less difficult for the simple-minded
to comprehend why political economists,
financiers, bank managers, and those highly gifted
men, financial journalists, cannot come to a common
agreement as to what it is banks create. There is
more agreement amongst them that banks do really
lend than there is as to the actual thing banks do
lend, credit or money.</p>

<p>Perhaps they do not lend at all, neither credit
nor money? Perhaps they no more lend than my
employer lends when he pays me my weekly cheque
for services rendered. We call them lenders, because
it would seem absurd to call them converters. Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
it seems obvious that they do quite a large business
in conversion, akin to what the Bank of
England does when it converts gold into notes.
The latter converts one species of wealth into one
species of currency; the joint stock banks convert
another species of wealth into another species of
currency.</p>

<p>My employer pays me a cheque for services
rendered. I am presumed to have produced some
kind of wealth, which is converted into liquid and
current capital when I receive the cheque and put
it in circulation. When he gives me the cheque he
does not give me credit. He pays me for the wealth
I have produced and which the community has
consumed, and that wealth goes to the common
store.</p>

<p>If a banker lends me, as it is said, £200 on
Consols—to put it in round, simple figures—does he
sell me his credit, or do I sell him mine? Or is
it, after all, barter? If it be bartering wealth, then
it cannot be credit. If he lends me £200 and takes
my Consols, he takes my wealth from me. It is no
longer in my possession. He has it, and if I leave
that £200 on deposit and do not withdraw a single
sovereign, he is wealthier to the extent of £200 than
he was before.</p>

<p>If he be so much wealthier, what has he exchanged
with me? What has he sold to me? If he lends me
£200 on my credit, plus the Consols, and I borrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
£200 from him on his credit, less the Consols, then
we seem to exchange credit for credit. If credit be a
species of wealth and credit be exchanged for credit,
then wealth is exchanged for wealth.</p>

<p>But, I repeat, this is not the sort of credit the
tradesman understands and lives on, nor is it the
man in the street’s conception of credit.</p>

<p>Yet it is declared by those who pretend to a deep
knowledge of human psychology and temperament,
that the stability of banks depends upon the credit
they enjoy amongst the members of the community,
and that that credit, in its turn, is dependent entirely
on the proportion of gold the banks hold to their
deposit and current accounts. It is quite possible
that this is a delusion. Financiers may have misread
the public and may not be completely acquainted
with their arithmetical preoccupations. I do not
believe that one man in 100,000 deliberately and
seriously sits down each evening and works out the
proportion of gold held by his particular bank in its
last balance sheet.</p>

<p>The ordinary individual believes that he can
use his leisure moments more profitably and more
pleasantly than in this occupation. I do not believe
that one man in 500,000 could say off-hand approximately
what is the proportion of his own bank or
the average proportion of all banks. He doesn’t
trouble to know, and he doesn’t bother himself about
it. He will tell you that he is burdened with quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
enough anxieties to trouble himself with this unnecessary
anxiety.</p>

<p>This is my experience of my fellow-men, and I
shall not put greater faith in financiers than in my
own experience until they have cross-examined every
individual depositor in the country and given me each
one’s answer.</p>

<p>If, therefore, it be a delusion that confidence
resides in individual knowledge of the exact proportion
of gold banks hold to their liabilities on deposit
and current account, then what is the basis of the
national confidence? It is not an individual confidence,
but a general confidence.</p>

<p>I believe that this confidence is based, and justly
based, on the belief that our banks are soundly
managed. This belief is a tradition, a habit, a
custom. We inherit it as a nation, and the inheritance
is handed on from generation to generation. We
can, indeed, say that it is in our blood, in our system.</p>

<p>Years have rolled on and this confidence has not
been abused. There have been times, of course, when
the country has found itself face to face with a
financial crisis, but it has been saved from disaster
by the wisdom of men in high financial stations and
by the common-sense of the nation. And this confidence
has been further strengthened by the manner
in which we have faced the greatest war in which the
nation has been involved.</p>

<p>I shall analyse the phenomenon further in later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
chapters, but I will say here that the manner in which
the general public received, as a mere matter of
course, the creation of the emergency currency notes
revealed a psychological trait, or characteristic, of
tremendous importance.</p>

<p>It is my belief, then—in fact, it is my conviction—that,
so far as the general public is concerned, its
confidence in banks rests more in the belief of their
honest and sound management than in the knowledge
of the exact amount of gold they have in their reserves,
or where they actually hold their reserves.
And I believe, too, that if all were interrogated, forty-four
millions and more out of forty-five millions, including
some of our shrewd bank managers, would
say they believed that that confidence would be
strengthened if the public were assured that all the
reserves were held at the Bank of England than in
the safes of the joint stock banks.</p>

<p>When the man in the street says that a something
is “as safe as the Bank of England,” it is no empty
phrase. The safety of the Bank of England is
ultimate, absolute safety. He associates the safety
of the Bank of England with the safety of the nation
itself. The Bank of England could fall only when
the Empire itself fell. And that fall, in his conception,
seems as remote as the fall of the skies.</p>

<p>He would tell you, and tell you with all solemnity
and earnestness, that he would rather have his money
at the Bank of England than elsewhere. And if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
were told that that is the very place where the joint
stock banks keep their gold reserves, he would say,
with equal seriousness: “That’s right.” His mind
would then be at rest that all was absolutely right in
the best of all banking worlds.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOUND BANKING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">If</span> it is indisputable, therefore, that the confidence of
the individual, and therefore the confidence of the
nation, is based in the soundness of banking, we
must see if that confidence be justified or not. I
have, indeed, already said that it is justified. I must
give reasons why I think so.</p>

<p>What is banking? What is soundness of banking?
These terms must be defined.</p>

<p>I do not know if a definition of banking has been
given that is universally acceptable. I know what
the vague conception of banking is, but if a precise,
explicit definition has ever been given, agreed upon
unanimously by economic theorists, and accepted as
the right and only formula, I am ignorant of that fact.</p>

<p>I consult Nuttall, and he describes a bank as an
establishment which trades in money, by receiving,
lending, exchanging, etc. He does not say it is an
establishment which trades in credit, by receiving,
lending, and exchanging credit, etc. This definition
may be false and misleading, and Mr. Nuttall may
have been deplorably ignorant of the functions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
a bank, but as, in my opinion, it is as good a definition
as I have met with in economic and financial
works, I will accept it. At any rate, I consider it in
no wise false or misleading.</p>

<p>A bank trades in money. This is indisputable.
A bank receives money. This is indisputable. A
bank lends money. This is indisputable. A bank
exchanges money. This also is indisputable.</p>

<p>What money does it trade in? We know there
are various kinds of money. Legal tender currency
is but one kind of money. Cheques, bills of exchange,
securities, and even commodities are other
kinds of money. Even if the legislature declared
that only legal tender shall be money, the legislature
could not by this declaration alter the laws of nature
and of economics. It can make one kind of money
legal tender, but it cannot destroy the law that anything
used for exchange purposes is money. If a
beggar steals a watch and afterwards exchanges the
watch for a decent shirt, the watch and the shirt
become money. They perform the functions of
money and the functions prove that they are money.</p>

<p>A bank trades in money subscribed by its own
shareholders and money deposited with it by the
public. A bank in the course of time finds itself in
the possession of what it describes as its deposit and
current accounts. These accounts, it is popularly
supposed—included in the populace are political
economists and City financiers—are the aggregate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
the money placed with a bank by the public and the
money with which it mainly trades.</p>

<p>These are called a bank’s liabilities, its immediate
liabilities the redemption of which can legally be
demanded at a moment’s notice. It is because they
can be so demanded that banks are ever faced with
a grave potential peril.</p>

<p>It is necessary to clear the way by destroying a
delusion. This money on deposit is not entirely
money placed in the keeping of a bank in the same
fashion as one would keep money in a safe. This
fact, in my view, is of great importance. Only a
portion of these deposits is what we may call in an
indefinite way pure deposits. By pure deposits I
mean money placed with a bank that is not a direct
loan. If I place £100 of my savings in a bank,
instead of investing it, I call that a pure deposit, and
this money I can withdraw without the subtraction
of a farthing at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>But we have already seen, from our analysis of a
bank’s <a href="#t23">balance sheet in Chapter III</a>, that these
deposits are not all pure deposits. A considerable
portion of them consists of loans to all kinds of
people, loans made on the security of various kinds
of wealth. That is to say, the bank owes money to
these so-called depositors and the depositors owe that
money to the bank. The depositors have the power,
of course, to withdraw the entire sum of money lent
to them temporarily by the bank; but the bank, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
due course, has the power to claim the redemption of
the loans. Not only has it this power to call in these
loans, but it actually possesses the equivalent of the
loans in a portion of the country’s wealth.</p>

<p>It is possible—but the wisdom or unwisdom of it
need not be discussed here—for the legislature to
enact that only pure deposits should be withdrawable
at a moment’s notice, and that borrowers should be
compelled in times of panic or vital urgency to give
long notice. I merely say that this is within the
power of the legislature to enact, but I do not say
here that it is practicable, necessary, or wise.</p>

<p>I merely throw out the hint here in order to
emphasize the importance of the distinction between
pure deposits and loan deposits. The latter, I have
already urged, may be regarded as the product of the
machinery for converting wealth into currency, or
liquid capital. From a sound banking standpoint
the vital question to be considered and answered is
as to the kind of wealth that is so converted.</p>

<p>Sound banking is to be tested by the nature of
the wealth so converted, or, in the language of the
financial community, the wealth on which loans are
made.</p>

<p>Others argue that this is a matter of quite
secondary and even third-rate importance. They
contend that the matter of supreme and vital
importance is the amount of gold a bank holds in
proportion to its liabilities in deposits. Should there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
be some differentiation here? Should it be the
amount of gold held in proportion to its pure
deposits, and not in proportion to its aggregation of
pure deposits and loan deposits? For the loans, as
we have seen, are automatically redeemable.</p>

<p>If, say, a bank habitually holds gold to the proportion
of 15 per cent. of its aggregate deposits,
and if half these deposits are loans, then the gold
Will be equal to 30 per cent. of its pure deposits, a
proportion much higher than the figure advocated by
those who agitate seriously and zealously for higher
gold reserves.</p>

<p>We have seen many small banks go under in
recent years. This was in some cases because they
lent their money on what I will call bad wealth. In
other words, because they gambled and speculated
with the money of their depositors. Here we have
some evidence that the general public are unable to
discriminate between sound and unsound banking.
This may be deplorable ignorance, but it is not
culpable ignorance. It is to a great degree inevitable
ignorance.</p>

<p>The matter is dismissed by the quidnuncs saying
that fools deserve their misfortune, they should have
placed their money in sound banks. We should not
so readily denounce them as fools. The Government
is not without its most serious responsibility in the
matter. It should not allow such money-lending
establishments to describe themselves as banks. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Government has a moral duty to protect the public,
and it would not be at all difficult to take steps to
this end. It should allow only those establishments
to call themselves banks that are conducted upon
sound banking principles.</p>

<p>Joint stock banks have a legal safeguard.
Though they are under compulsion to repay deposits,
they are under no legal compulsion to repay them in
gold. They must repay them in legal tender, and
they can fulfil their legal obligations by paying out
in legal tender notes. These, of course, are Bank of
England notes and now the new Treasury emergency
notes.</p>

<p>This being so it is immaterial, or it should be
immaterial, whether the reserve of a bank consists of
gold or legal tender notes. If it can redeem its
liabilities in notes and has sufficient notes for its
purpose, it can consider itself safe and can securely
stand in a crisis. The notes can, of course, be taken
to the Bank of England and be exchanged there for
gold; but this is immaterial to a bank which has
successfully met the peril of a run.</p>

<p>Soundness of banking consists in the soundness
of the wealth that constitutes a bank’s assets. We
know there are infinite degrees and categories of
wealth. But it is easily possible to discriminate and
know exactly which is the highest class of wealth in
the country.</p>

<p>Banks do and must speculate to some extent. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
is unavoidable. If they did not speculate they
would not incur bad and doubtful debts. But they
must keep their speculations within the most prudent
limits. This most of them undoubtedly do. Traders
complain that they are, indeed, too cautious in this
respect, that they do not lend freely enough. There
have been, indeed, most bitter complaints on this
head since the outbreak of the war.</p>

<p>But we cannot reasonably insist upon banks being
ultra-cautious, and in the same breath complain of
their cautiousness. We cannot reasonably insist
upon them keeping large gold reserves, thereby
diminishing their loan capacity, and with equal
reason insist that they shall lend with increased
liberality.</p>

<p>This is as impossible as trying to reach two goals
simultaneously, when each lies in a direction opposite
to the other. The man in the street would say you
cannot eat your cake and have it.</p>

<p>When a bank lends to a man or firm on good
security, it cannot be sure, of course, that that man
or firm will be able to pay off the loan when it falls
due.</p>

<p>We may, if we wish, call this a speculative chance,
but the bank is considerably safeguarded by the
security it possesses.</p>

<p>Public confidence is based, therefore, upon the
soundness of banking methods. It is an article of
belief with us that banks become gravely imperilled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
when confidence breaks down. It is when confidence
is destroyed that runs on banks commence. Fear
seizes the public, it develops into panic, depositors
clamour for their deposit money, and banks either
successfully meet these runs, or close their doors.
But so long as confidence is strong and unimpaired,
sound banks keep safe.</p>

<p>The safety of banks depends, therefore, upon this
feeling of confidence in them, and this feeling of confidence,
in its turn, is based upon the intelligence and
common sense of the public. Up to now this intelligence
and common sense have been triumphant. They
have triumphed in a crisis unparalleled in the history
of the British Empire, in that very crisis, in fact, which
the prophets always feared would show their superficiality
and vulnerability.</p>

<p>The predictions of the prophets have not been
realized. This is because human genius and
human wisdom have been mightier than human fear
and apprehension, because the nation had supreme
faith in the Government, in the economic strength of
the Empire, and in the might of its navy and army.</p>

<p>And if the prophets have prophesied falsely in this
supreme situation, they are just as likely to prophesy
falsely in other potential emergencies.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SUPERSTRUCTURE OF WEALTH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> our loose and indefinite way—as a result, maybe,
of our defective vision—we talk of a vast superstructure
of credit erected on a tiny gold basis. We
gaze upon this mighty fabric and shake our heads
ominously. As we gaze we see the structure grow,
extending upwards and outwards, enlarging itself by
some invisible and mysterious agency, and when we
cast our gaze to the foundations we see that it looks
like a towering edifice perched insecurely on a small,
uneven piece of rock. No wonder we have feared
that when storms break the whole crazy thing will
come crashing down, scattering ruin and devastation
in a vast area around it. It seems to us like a
structure built by a madman, in defiance of the laws
of architecture, and that there can be but one end,
sooner or later, to so fantastic a fabric.</p>

<p>So have we been told time and again that our
superstructure of credit has been built only for fair
weather and not for foul.</p>

<p>Well, it has withstood much foul weather since
the building of it commenced generations ago.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Storms have beaten against it, and to the naked eye
it has hardly swerved. The storms have made no
rents in its walls, and it still stands, growing visibly,
pointing its rising apex to the skies, and millions of
people to this day—stolid, unimaginative Britishers,
maybe—enter within its portals fearlessly and without
suspicion of their peril. They heed not those
who warn them that the whole thing may fall about
their heads at any moment, that it needs but an
earthquake, and all will be over in the twinkling of
an eye.</p>

<p>“Foolish people!” these architectural guardians
of safety cry. “We have warned you, and you have
heeded us not. Let your fate be upon your own
heads. Let him who is guided by the feeble, confusing
light of his own folly, suffer the doom of his
folly. We, at least, have done our duty, bravely, like
voices crying unto the lost multitude, drunk with its
ignorance and conceit.”</p>

<p>Well! well! Perhaps, after all, this superstructure
may have no counterpart in reality. It
may be but a fantastic dream, or nightmare, after
all, yet seemingly so vivid to our fearsomeness that
we find it almost impossible to believe that it can be
but a creation of the imagination.</p>

<p>Would it not be more accurate to say that we
have erected in our midst a vast superstructure of
wealth? And cannot we say that this superstructure
is based, not upon a slight foundation of gold, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
upon the solid wealth of the nation, the empire, the
world? If it can be proved to our nervous eyes that
this is the real superstructure, after all, and not the
one we have seen in disturbing visions, perhaps we
shall feel more secure against and less apprehensive
of the force of storms.</p>

<p>Let us look more closely at that balance sheet,
for then we shall come into actual physical contact
with the composition of this awe-striking structure.
We will analyse the various ingredients which we
shall describe as the assets of a bank.</p>

<p>First of all, we see that the cash in hand and at
the Bank of England is nearly £6,000,000. This is
legal tender, that which the law of the land has
enacted shall be absolute, permanent wealth, not
subject to the vagaries of fashion or sentiment.</p>

<p>Money at call and short notice is nearly as much—over
five and a half millions. This forms a
portion of the loan deposits, and being callable by
the banks practically on demand, they show that a
portion of the deposits payable on demand can also
be recalled on demand. The equivalent of these
loans, or deposits, the bank possesses in the shape
of wealth not in the absolute category of legal
tender. They are securities of the highest class,
securities representing the credit or wealth of the
nation. While these securities are lying in the safes
of the banks they have been converted into temporary
currency, and have been fulfilling all the purposes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
money in circulation. They have been resurrected
from dead into live capital. A similar process could
be gone through by selling the securities in the
market. The owner could convert them for his
purposes into liquid capital. But he sells them
temporarily to the bank instead of permanently in
the market, and when he has employed his liquid
capital temporarily, he repays it to the bank. He
rechanges it, as it were, into dead or illiquid capital,
until the moment comes when he desires to reconvert
it into live capital, or currency. The bank possesses
the wealth in bonds; he possesses the wealth in
currency, and the bank’s gain consists of the interest
on the accommodation, and his gain in the profit
accruing from the active employment of his capital.</p>

<p>There is no more trust than a butcher has when
he sells a leg of mutton for 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> on the nail. His
dead leg of mutton he converts into live legal tender
currency. If he never sold his mutton he would
starve. If the housewife’s husband earned no more
salary wherewith to exchange it for future legs of
mutton they would starve.</p>

<p>If the banker lent the borrower money without
security, it would be more truly credit, for he would
have no wealth that was the equivalent of the
loan.</p>

<p>If he, at certain seasons, is compelled to call in
these loans to bill-brokers and others and cannot
renew them—quite a frequent, familiar operation—those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
who want to convert their dead wealth into
currency go to the Bank of England. Machinery
similar to that employed in the joint stock banks
is put into operation there. The Bank takes in the
securities, debits itself with the amount it empowers
the borrower to withdraw in currency, and credits
itself, not with words, but with valuable bonds. It
insists that these bonds shall be of the highest value,
and this insistence is inconsistent with the idea of
what the ordinary man regards as giving credit.
Otherwise, there would be greater trust in promises
than in securities.</p>

<p>The objection borrowers have in going to the
Bank of England is, they have to pay more for the
services rendered. In the phraseology of Lombard
Street, they have to pay higher interest for their
loans, and being ordinary mortals, not too full of the
milk of self-sacrifice, they prefer to go where they
can deal more cheaply. This is precisely the motive
that sends the housewife to the cheap butcher. She
might get her leg of mutton a farthing a pound
cheaper than if she went to the dear, extortionate
butcher.</p>

<p>And there are some people in the City who have
whispered that the Bank of England is extortionate.
And those who have listened to them have made
grimaces not altogether unlike expressions of sympathy
and agreement.</p>

<p>Still keeping our attention on the balance sheet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
and turning it for a moment from the stern, unbending
business men at the Bank of England, we find
that the legal tender and the call loans total over
eleven millions and a half, and the deposits are thirty-seven
millions and a half.</p>

<p>Next, investments exceed £6,000,000. The
balance sheet says these investments consist of
Consols and other securities of, or guaranteed by,
the British Government, Indian, Colonial, and other
securities.</p>

<p>I do not think any critics, not even financial
journalists—for do not the public ask their advice
what to invest in?—will deny that here we have the
cream of investments. We could not, not the brainiest
critic of us all, imagine anything creamier. Why,
these are the creamiest things that make a hungry
City editor’s mouth water. I dare say the most
humble of them would confess that if a kind-hearted
employer would only give him a few thousand pounds’
worth, he would not waste his intellectual resources
in writing another line of financial criticism. He
would be so content with this wealth that he could
till his death-moment repose in absolute idleness and
enjoy contemplation of the continued labours of less
fortunate City journalists.</p>

<p>Here, then, is an aggregation of approximately
£18,000,000 of first-class wealth, or nearly 50 per
cent. of the total pure and loan deposits.</p>

<p>Bills discounted approach £7,000,000. I need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
not spend much labour in analysing and describing
what bills of discount are. Those who wish a detailed
description must consult other works dealing more
fully with elementals. It is sufficient to say here
that these bills represent also the best class of wealth,
distinct, of course, from gilt-edged securities, but
wealth, nevertheless, of the highest character. They
represent produce, raw materials, manufactures of a
vast and varied character, and when the bank has in
its possession these bills which it has discounted, it
practically has the varied wealth they represent.</p>

<p>Cheques are to be regarded as our national
currency, bills of exchange are to be regarded as
international currency. Cheques are wealth converted
into national currency. When a bank discounts
bills it enables them to perform also all the
functions of our national currency. Until they are
so discounted their functions are limited to their
international purposes.</p>

<p>This is one of the purposes served in re-discounting
them with the joint stock banks.</p>

<p>The great bill-broking firms and discount houses
discount them on behalf of customers and re-discount
them with banks. It is in the re-discounting that
they make their profits and continue their existence.
They cannot tie up their capital in these investments.
They must re-discount them in order to liquefy
them and restore their capital. And all the vast
wealth behind the bills thereby becomes liquid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
capital that can continue fructifying instead of becoming
stagnant.</p>

<p>Now this wealth, I say, the banks indirectly
possess. It is theirs. They buy it. And if they
buy it and it comes into their possession and they
exchange money for it, as merchants and tradesmen
do, how do they grant credit? When the wealth is
eventually sold the proceeds go into the coffers of
the banks, and the banks hand over the promises to
pay. But the promises to pay are more tangible
than the promises of the schemer who flits from
suburb to suburb and town to town living on what
is called credit.</p>

<p>Then there is the other composite wealth amounting
to over £16,000,000. These are advances to
tradesmen, merchants, and other persons well known
to bank managers, who deposit some kind of wealth
as security.</p>

<p>They are loans to all sorts of people who have
pledged all sorts of wealth with banks. This wealth,
in other words, they have liquefied and the banks
have been paid consideration for liquefying it. People
have parted with the wealth, sold it, if you like, and
it has been passed over into the possession of the
banks.</p>

<p>Adding these to the other loans we make a total
of nearly £22,000,000, which compose that portion
of the deposits which we call loan deposits. If we
add the bills discounted as another form of loan the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
total is raised to £28,700,000 out of a total of
£37,600,000 of deposits. This leaves a residue of
£9,000,000 of pure deposits against which the bank
holds £6,000,000 of legal tender, or over 60 per cent.
If we add the £6,000,000 of investments, the total
considerably exceeds the aggregate of the pure
deposits.</p>

<p>Ought the position to be made clearer to the
public, to the unsophisticated man in the street, by
segregating the deposits and showing their component
elements? What is the objection? Will some great
bank start reform in this direction if it be earnestly
and sincerely desired to show the public exactly what
the position of affairs is; if it be sincerely desired to
surround the groping man in the street with a bright
light? Why not extend reform here after commencing
with the segregation of a bank’s legal tender
reserve?</p>

<p>I can imagine, however, that the refusal would
be strenuous.</p>

<p>Are the pure deposits credit? If they are not
credit, entirely distinct from the loan deposits, but
consist of money in some form or other lodged with
the banks, they cannot form a part of what is
described as the credit superstructure of the banks.
The so-called credit superstructure must be composed,
then, of the loan deposits which are at one and the
same time loans by the bank, and loans to the bank.
If they are other people’s liabilities and at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
time the bank’s liabilities, whose credit are they?
The borrower trusts the bank and the bank trusts
the borrower; whose credit comes first? Who is
the first creator of the credit? It is as difficult to
answer as the question which came into the world
first, the egg or the chicken?</p>

<p>No matter how we answer the conundrum, it
seems to me indisputable that what we gaze upon
is a superstructure of wealth. And it is indisputable
that the banks furnish machinery vital to the
progress of humanity. And it seems to me vital to
the interests of national well-being that every
resource should be ready to prevent the collapse of
any sound banking establishment.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHAT IS THE LOANABLE FUND?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> loanable fund in Lombard Street is said to be
the totality of the deposits in the possession of the
joint stock and other banks, plus the deposits in the
Bank of England. We will, however, for the moment
leave out the Bank of England as being immaterial
in the present stage of our argument. Let us confine
ourselves to the deposits in the joint stock banks,
and let us assume that these total £800,000,000.
What is called the loanable fund, therefore, is a
mass of money aggregating £800,000,000. If a
merchant or any other person desires to get a loan
he gets a portion of this huge sum, and the commerce
and industries of the country are financed
thereout.</p>

<p>It has been likened by the imaginative to a
vast reservoir of money, into which money is constantly
flowing from many channels, and out of
which it flows into a great number of channels. In
fact, these channels form a mighty network, like the
veins of the human body, and as the steady flow of
blood to all parts of the body is essential to health<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
and life, so the steady flow of money throughout
the economic organism is essential to its health and
life.</p>

<p>It is indisputable that money or capital, however
we designate the element, is vital to the well-being of
the economic organism of the State. Without this
provision the organism would in time decay and
perish. Therefore some perennial source of this
life-giving and life-preserving element should be
provided by the Government or some other organization
if the nation is to thrive and progress. As the
Government has not hitherto provided that source,
and as the banks alone provide it, let us examine the
peculiar character and essence of that element.</p>

<p>We have seen that this so-called loanable fund,
or reservoir of capital, consists of money hoarded
with the banks by the public and loans by the banks
to other members of the public. These deposits are,
in fact, representative for the most part of fixed
capital. It is the habit to call them mere book
entries, intangible and invisible, and that the only
sign of their existence are the figures written in the
books of a bank.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to show, however, that so far
from being intangible, they are tangible, because
they are the composite wealth of the community in
possession, not of the community, but of the banks.
It follows, therefore, that the loanable fund of the
country does not consist of an intangible something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
called credit, book liabilities, but of a certain portion
of the wealth of the country.</p>

<p>Now this must necessarily be so. Wealth is the
source of wealth and the fruit of wealth. If you use
wealth you produce wealth. We call the product
wealth, or capital, the terms being interchangeable.
Capital is wealth, therefore wealth must be capital,
and if the banks possess wealth they possess capital.
Wealth or capital is valued in the terms of money.
We know of no other terms than money for valuation
purposes. If we say a pound of cheese is worth a
pound of tobacco, we mean nothing unless we make
simultaneously a calculation by the common standard
of value.</p>

<p>The cheese is worth sixpence, we say, or one-fortieth
of a sovereign, and the tobacco is worth
sixpence. If I borrow sixpence from the cheese-monger
and give him my tobacco I create a loanable
fund, for I can lend the sixpence to some one else for
half a pound of tea as security, and the third person
can lend it to some one else, and so on <i lang="la">ad infinitum</i>
till the sixpence drops down a deep well and is lost.
Though the sixpence be destroyed the wealth it has
created in the course of its existence is not destroyed,
for we assume that it has been used profitably and
fructifyingly in the hands of successive borrowers.</p>

<p>If the wealth of the country constitutes the
loanable fund, it is possible to make this wealth
fruitful only by converting it into currency and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
making it flowable, or liquid. We know that a
stagnant pool will not irrigate land. We know that
it must be made to flow along innumerable channels.
The pool of water is as unfructifying as fixed or
stagnant capital. In order to make fixed capital
flow and enrich the area through which it passes it
must be re-converted into its original substance,
currency. Fixed capital is rigid currency, as ice is
rigid water. It is frozen. Well, the banks merely
unfreeze it, or thaw it. It is a misuse of language
and terms to describe this thawing process as a
creation of credit.</p>

<p>Now the Government does the same thing when
it issues its war loan. It unfreezes fixed capital; it
starts into fruitful circulation hoarded capital. A
similar effect follows other loans and other promotions.
The Bank of England does precisely the
same thing when it unfreezes gold direct from the
mines by giving notes for it. The gold is fixed, or
rigid, frozen capital. It is useless for fructifying
purposes of a certain character, and in order to make
it fructiferous, or fruitful, it has to be submitted to
the reconversion process. When it has gone through
this process it is able to perform exactly the same
functions, or the same services, as the conversion of
other wealth into currency by the banks.</p>

<p>How is it that in one case the Bank of England
is said not to create credit, and in the other case the
banks create credit, when the two processes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
identical? Because, we say, the Bank of England
gives legal tender currency for the gold, and the banks
give only custom currency for the wealth. The one
is not exactly a loan, it is argued, but the other is.</p>

<p>If gold were a commodity, just ordinary wealth,
would it be a loan then? The answer is that gold
is not a commodity. But we know that gold is a
commodity until it has been minted into sovereigns.
As an ordinary export and import it is a commodity.</p>

<p>But, the answer comes, the notes are legal tender
and legal tender is not credit. Here comes in the
schism, the casuistry. Fundamentally, the argument
is this. The conversion of wealth into ordinary
money or currency is credit, the conversion of
wealth into legal tender is not credit.</p>

<p>As the banks lend, therefore, something over and
beyond the exact amount of legal tender they
possess, they create credit. If they lend only the
sum equal to their legal tender they do not create
credit. Therefore, credit is a something not inherent
in legal tender.</p>

<p>Now pure deposits are loaned to banks. Therefore
the pure deposits, if they are credit, are the
credit of the depositors. If I exchange gold for notes
at the Bank of England and deposit those notes with
a bank, the bank has not created these notes and,
therefore, has not created credit. And the legal
tender notes are, as I have already said, no part of
the structure of credit. The legal tender notes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
loaned to borrowers, or exchanged for other people’s
wealth, and in ordinary business transactions there
is no credit when there is equal exchange. Credit
comes in when there is no direct exchange, or when
there is unequal exchange.</p>

<p>No wonder the views on this complicated problem
are irreconcilable. I may recall what Mr. A.&nbsp;C. Cole,
a director of the Bank of England, said years ago,
in an argument between him and Mr. Tritton, the
President of the Institute of Bankers.</p>

<p>“Now, I was very much surprised, on reading
Mr. Tritton’s paper, to find him stating that the
commonly accepted opinion that a bank can create
credit is a pure fallacy. In my opinion, if a bank
does not create credit, it cannot make a profit; in
fact, it is by the creation of credit that banks earn
their dividends. While I was surprised at the above-mentioned
statement, I was equally surprised to find
that a number of the bankers who took part in the
discussion which followed his paper seemed to accept
the statement as correct.”</p>

<p>Banks seem to me to make their profits by taking
a share of the profits earned by the merchants and
tradesmen of this country. The profits of the country
are divided, as we all know, amongst the capitalists,
the retailers, and the working people. If there were
no such division of profits industry would come to
a standstill, and the community would starve. The
producers share their profits with the consumers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the consumers with the producers. It is impossible
for one branch of the community to amass all the
profits and the other branches to have none.</p>

<p>The banks form one branch of the community
that takes a due share of the aggregate profits of the
community.</p>

<p>The banker says <i lang="la">de facto</i> to the merchant who
borrows from him: “I will help you to make your
capital liquid so that you can continually earn profits
by the use of it, if you will remunerate me by giving
me a portion of your profits.” The merchant readily
agrees to the bargain, knowing that it would be a bad
bargain for him if he did not earn with his mobile
capital larger profits than he would hand over to the
bank. If he makes ten per cent., say, he gives the
bank two or three per cent. If the bank made no
charge for its services, the merchant would then have
the greater part of the ten per cent. The merchant
is the middleman between the capitalist—that is, the
banker—and the consumer, and the middleman gets
the profits of the middleman. Unless the bank provided
him with the capital he would be helpless.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that a bank’s profits are
not something over and above, out of the sphere of
the total profits of the community, but are a share of
them, just as my employer shares with me the profits
he makes. If he paid me no salary, his personal
profits would be larger. But they are diminished to
the extent of the salary he gives me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>When banks raise their interest for loans it is
tantamount to raising the price of their services.
That is to say, they demand a larger share in the
profits of the community. Merchants then try, in
their turn, to obtain a larger portion of the profits of
the community.</p>

<p>Less wealth is then liquefied, the wheels of trade
begin to revolve more slowly, and depression sometimes
begins. Profits diminish, less capital and
wealth are produced, and the effect is subsequently
seen in the so-called loanable fund.</p>

<p>The character of the loanable fund alters, however,
in times of depression. The pure deposits then
increase and the loan deposits diminish. As it
becomes less profitable to liquefy fixed capital, then
less wealth is taken to the banks to be liquefied, and
therefore the banks have to take their lessened share
of the aggregate profits of the community. But a
considerable portion of capital already in liquid form
in the shape of profits, instead of being reconverted
into fixed capital, remains liquid, and in its liquid
form is hoarded with the banks. But this hoarded,
liquid capital is not credit now, although in its origin
it was called credit. Even those who hold that banks
originally created the credit will hardly deny that
these deposits are now money, even though the money
may be the product of former bank loans, or former
liquefaction of wealth. If in their original liquefaction
they were credit, why are they not credit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
now? At what precise moment did they become no-credit?
If they originated as credit why are they
not permanent credit?</p>

<p>However, we see the character of the loanable
fund change. The pure deposits grow, the loan-deposits
diminish, and banks are said to have more
money or capital than they can employ. This is so,
even if the aggregate of the deposits is precisely the
same before the depression as after it, the increase in
the pure deposits being, say, merely equal to the
decrease in the loan deposits.</p>

<p>Why, if the deposits are equal in amount, is the
loanable fund much greater in times of depression
than in times of activity, and why do rates for loans
fall?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII"><span id="toclink_70"></span>CHAPTER VIII<br>

<span class="subhead">THE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE FUND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">This</span> is because of the character of legal tender
currency, and a legal tender currency, however
desirable and however great its merits, must necessarily
have its shortcomings in a progressive state.</p>

<p>The loanable fund is restricted, or controlled, not
by the growth of the country’s wealth, but by the
production of gold. To control it by so artificial and
arbitrary a circumstance as the output of gold may
seem absurd, and from a strictly logical and economic
standpoint it is absurd. The loanable fund ought to
be governed entirely by the production of wealth, and
not by something entirely independent of wealth and
having no natural or economic connection with it.</p>

<p>I am now speaking of the loanable fund which
collects in the joint stock banks. Of the other loanable
fund, which collects in the Bank of England, I
will speak later.</p>

<p>What the banks lend is liquid wealth, but the
amount they can lend at any given moment is
governed less by the amount of wealth that is brought
to them than by the amount of gold they possess.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
This is the gold which, we say, constitutes their
reserves.</p>

<p>Let us assume that it is the custom of the banks
to keep a gold, or, rather, a legal tender reserve—it is
chiefly composed of Bank of England notes—equal to
fifteen per cent. of their combined pure and loan
deposits. It follows that the growth of these deposits
must be controlled by this fifteen per cent. reserve.
This is so in practice. When the reserve begins to
fall below this fifteen per cent., then the banks cease
liquefying wealth and increasing the loan fund.
When the reserve increases beyond the fifteen per
cent., then the banks continue to liquefy the wealth.</p>

<p>It is then said that money—some say credit—is
abundant, and the banks cannot find full employment
for it. When the reserve falls it is said that money—or
credit—is becoming scarce. We find, therefore,
that the loan-fund actually contracts when trade is
active, and expands when trade is depressed. In the
economic interests of the nation the fund should grow
simultaneously with and commensurately with the
growth of trade and commerce.</p>

<p>In times of activity more wealth is created. It is
like an abundant harvest resulting from a favourable
season. In times of inactivity less wealth is created,
to be likened to bad seasons and poor harvests. In
times of activity there is necessarily and inevitably a
greater demand for capital, that is to say, for more
liquefied wealth. Bills of discount multiply, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
are taken to the banks as security for loans, in other
words, to be converted into liquid form. Another
phrase is, into floating capital. If they could not be
so converted, the needs of the community in such
times could not be met, for the bills of discount could
not be used as currency, or capital, like cheques.
They are discounted at the banks in order that they
may be transformed into cheques, the representatives
of floating or circulating capital. In this form they
are able to reproduce wealth more rapidly than if
they had to remain in their original form.</p>

<p>So it is with other forms of wealth, all are taken
to the banks to be converted into quickly reproductive
shape.</p>

<p>But the banks have to keep an eye on that gold
reserve, watch it closely. Managers have to calculate
when the limit of their conversion powers will be
reached, and when it is reached their wealth-liquefying
machinery has for the time being to cease working.
It does not follow that when the machinery of
one bank has to stop, the machinery of all the banks
simultaneously stops. The limit may not yet have
been reached in other banks. Borrowers, as they are
called, then rush to them, and as the numbers grow
and the pressure increases, so is the limit of the other
banks more speedily reached, until at last the entire
machinery comes to a stop. It often comes to a stop
when in the interests of the economic welfare of the
nation it should be working most actively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>But the machinery is controlled by another
independent agency, and the economic interests of
the nation must suffer the effects of this obtrusive
force.</p>

<p>If this independent force be at times harmful and
not beneficial to the economic welfare and progress of
the nation, what is to be said of the cry that this
force, in the most urgent times, should be made more
interfering and harmful? What is to be said of the
cry that at the moment when the need is greatest
then the succour should be restricted?</p>

<p>What should we say of the doctor who by ligatures
prevented the free flow of blood in the body of an
active, energetic man, in order to paralyse his
energies and enforce rest? We should say that he
was not only an unscientific doctor, ignorant of the
functions of the bodily organism, but that he was
actually killing his patient. These gold reserves,
therefore, act like ligatures, for they stop the free
and health-giving flow of economic blood at the very
moment when the flow should be stimulated.</p>

<p>In inactive times we see the metamorphosis of the
fund take place. The loan deposits decrease, because
the liquefied wealth becomes frozen again and the
production of wealth decreases, while the pure
deposits grow. The fact that the loan deposits
decrease simultaneously with the contraction of
wealth production is an additional proof that the
loanable fund is wealth in liquid form. As the wealth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
in fixed form is withdrawn from the bank so the loan
deposits drop.</p>

<p>Now the increased pure deposits may be regarded
as a portion of the harvests gathered from the fructifying
use of the liquid capital in times of activity.
They are called the profits, or the savings of capital.
They accumulate in times of depression. For lack
of other employment they are placed on deposit with
the banks. They are, in a way, loaned to the banks,
and the banks are supposed to lend this money to
the classes of borrowers already described. But the
banks at these times benefit, or are presumed to
benefit, not because the aggregate of the deposits
grow enormously compared with other periods, but
because these pure deposits bring them more gold.
The loan deposits take gold, the pure deposits bring
gold.</p>

<p>This is why, the aggregate being the same, or
even less, the potential loanable fund is greater in
inactive than in active times of trade. The gold
reserves increase and the proportion of the reserves
to the aggregate deposits rises. When this proportion
rises, the banks say they can afford to let it fall,
and therefore they can liquefy more wealth if there
were more wealth to liquefy. But there is less wealth
to liquefy, and therefore money is now said to be
abundant and cheap. The banks are willing to take
less interest, that is to say, a smaller share of the
profits earned by liquefied capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>But depositors also have to take a smaller share
of these profits. The banks divide their smaller
share of the profits with the pure depositors, and,
therefore, can give only a smaller rate of interest on
the deposits. Dissatisfied with this small rate of
interest, depositors seek for other channels of use,
other forms of investment, and when they find these
other channels, they withdraw their deposits and
reconvert them into fixed or frozen capital. They
may speculate with them in mining or rubber shares,
or invest them in Consols or War Loans. When
this is done, gold is automatically withdrawn from
the banks and the proportion may drop. Should the
proportion drop, banks can lend less, and the potential
resources for liquefying capital becoming less, they
can begin to charge more for these services.</p>

<p>When the pure deposits increase the reserve of
gold automatically increases. Therefore, though the
risks of the banks increase, because the liabilities on
demand increase, so the power to meet those risks
automatically increases. This being so, the necessity
for increasing gold reserves is less apparent; for they
increase automatically. When the pure deposits
decrease and the loan deposits increase the proportion
falls, but it falls at a time when the risks are lessened
if set against the pure deposits as distinct from the
loans owing to the bank.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, owing to the constantly
fluctuating character of a bank’s liabilities, or risks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
it is impossible to maintain a fixed, undeviating
reserve, whether it be a high reserve or a low reserve.
And we know that this impossibility is demonstrated
every day in Lombard Street.</p>

<p>It is demonstrated at the end of each month,
when the banks cease lending, and when they compel
their loan depositors to pay in their loans. This is
proof that a proportion of the deposits are loans to
the bank. As these loan deposits thereby contract,
banks cannot compel the pure depositors to withdraw
their deposits, therefore the proportion of the gold
reserve to the <em>whole</em> rises, and the wish of those who
clamour for high reserves is fulfilled.</p>

<p>This policy is resorted to because an idea exists
amongst bankers that, instead of going to theatres
and other places of amusement, the public, as a
body, spends its leisure time during the closing days
of each month working out the proportion of the
reserves to the total deposits. This is a fantastic
dream. The public does nothing of the kind. It is
fallacious to imagine the public working out the
proportions minutely and then deciding in strictly
mathematical fashion whether a bank is safe or not,
and whether there is likely to be an immediate run
upon it or not. If bankers and theoretical financiers
were only gifted with the power to understand human
psychology there would be less contention amongst
them on questions of pure theory. They would not
magnify the unimportant at the expense of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
important functions of banking, and magnify the
superficial at the expense of the deep traits of British
character.</p>

<p>We see the same policy adopted at the end of
each half-year, or year, when the banks make up
their half-yearly or yearly balance sheets. Such a
great deal has been made of this high reserve need—as
though it were possible for any mortal being to
draw up an absolute line of safety—that at these
periods trade is penalized because bankers imagine
that the millions of this nation are auditing their
accounts. They see them poring over these accounts
in the great castles of the realm, and in the cottages
of the poor. It is a pure delusion, and if the millions
engaged themselves voluntarily in these uncongenial
tasks, the result would only be national confusion,
and not national agreement. There can be national
agreement on one thing connected with the banking
system, and one thing only, alike in the mansion and
in the cottage, and that is agreement upon the
honesty and soundness of that system. And honesty
and soundness are not to be tested solely by the bulk
of the legal tender reserves.</p>

<p>The only members of the community who, perhaps,
might be more concerned than others about
these reserves are the very members who share the
responsibility equally with the banks. They are those
who borrow from the banks, who get their liquid capital
there. All they have to do is to cease borrowing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
cease converting their wealth into currency, and the
thing is done. The remedy is in their hands.</p>

<p>Do they do this? No. Do they show this feverish
concern? No. What do they do? These men, who
have more at stake than the other millions, actually
growl when the banks refuse to liquefy their wealth.
They make it a grievance, and a sore grievance. To
imagine, therefore, that these growlers are watching
minutely the movements in the reserve is a delusion
verging near to absurdity.</p>

<p>When some bank managers tell borrowers they
must repay their loans, then they rush round to
other bank managers, caring not a fig about reserves
so long as they can get the accommodation they want,
for their needs are above all other considerations.
And when they find that no bank manager will serve
them, and when all bank managers tell them they
are sold out, then they have to go to the Bank of
England. They do not like to go to the Bank of
England, because they have to pay more for the
services that Bank renders. That is to say, they
have to share with the Bank of England a larger
portion of the profits they make than the portion
they would divide with the joint stock banks.</p>

<p>By this analysis we see that the deposits of a
bank, the so-called loanable fund, consists of pure
deposits, which we may call cash deposits, and loan-deposits,
which those who believe in credit creation
call credit deposits. These latter deposits represent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the wealth placed with the bank, and so long as this
wealth is in liquid form in these deposits it cannot
be employed in its fixed form. These deposits are
loans owing by the bank and owing to the bank.
Others call them credit deposits created by the banks
themselves.</p>

<p>These loans are made in relation to the proportion
each bank is in the habit of maintaining between its
cash, or legal tender reserves, and the deposits as a
whole. The loan deposits increase or decrease according
as this proportion rises or falls.</p>

<p>It is left to the discretion of each bank to decide
what the proportion shall be. There is no legal
compulsion. Therefore it is their practice to retain
the minimum ratio which they consider sufficient for
their safety. When this safety limit is passed, then
they stop lending and proceed to call in their loans.
The totality of the deposits automatically diminishes,
and though not a sovereign has been added to the
reserve, the proportion rises.</p>

<p>This, then, is the important point. Not so much
the amount of the reserve, as the proportion. One
bank may have fifty millions in its reserve, and
another bank only fifteen. But the smaller bank
may have a higher proportion to its liabilities and
the larger bank a smaller proportion. The test,
therefore, if there must be a test, is the proportion
of the reserve to the total liabilities, and with this I
shall deal more fully later on.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CENTRAL FUND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">What</span> I call the Central loanable fund is the fund in
what financial journalists call the Central Institution.
This is not to be regarded as an institution standing
in the centre of a great circle of banks, with directing
chords, as it were, radiating from this governing
centre. Why it is called the Central Institution I do
not know, except it be a birth of the mother of
invention, or a need arising out of the limitations
of the English language.</p>

<p>But the origins are unimportant. The Bank of
England, let us say, stands in an unique position,
and it is a banking institution that possesses great,
but not absolute, autocratic powers. The public
attribute to it greater powers, and surround it with a
greater glory and majesty than it probably possesses.
This is a psychological fact of significance. It is the
Bank <em>of England</em>. That is <em>the</em> Bank; the Bank that
props up the nation, and which the nation in its
turn props up. It is a mutual propping up. The
one cannot fall headlong and leave the other standing
erect. Both must stand or fall together. As,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
however, in the consciousness of the community the
nation is unshakable—then it follows that the Bank
of England is in the nation’s view unshakable.</p>

<p>Let me say, before I proceed further, that there
is no delusion in this. It is a fact of tremendous
import.</p>

<p>Where a delusion does exist is in the belief or
consciousness that the Bank of England is a State
bank and not a private bank like other banks. It
is, however, a private bank, like other banks, performs
similar functions, earns its profits in the same way
and distributes its dividends to its shareholders in
the same fashion. It is a proprietary establishment,
run by the directors for the benefit primarily of its
shareholders.</p>

<p>It is only a State Bank in that the Government
deposits its funds with it alone, borrows from it now
and then, and employs the Bank as its medium for
issuing loans, paying interest on the funds and performing
many other functions on its behalf. These
functions, it need scarcely be said, are not performed
gratuitously. They provide a source of income for
the Bank.</p>

<p>The Bank of England is also a banker for the
private individual in the same way as an ordinary
joint stock bank is.</p>

<p>It is also the banker’s bank. It may seem strange
to some people to learn that the banks themselves
have a common bank. This common bank is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Bank of England. But they bank with it in a strictly
limited way. They do not borrow from it, nor discount
or, rather, re-discount bills of exchange there.
The Bank of England is to the joint stock banks a
limited convenience.</p>

<p>They deposit what is called their reserve funds
there. In the balance sheet we have examined we
see that that particular joint stock bank possessed in
coin in hand and at the Bank of England a sum
aggregating £5,996,668. How much it had in its
own safes and how much at the Bank of England,
no outsider can divine. At any rate, we learn that a
portion of it was in the keeping of the Bank of
England.</p>

<p>This reserve performs two functions. It acts as
a part reserve against deposits, or liabilities, and it
helps in adjusting the balances between the various
banks, the adjustment being made in the books of
the Bank of England.</p>

<p>I need not describe here the methods of the
bankers’ clearing house, how each day the cheques
are cleared, and how each bank at the close of each
day finds out how it stands in relation to the other
banks. Debits are settled, not by a direct transfer of
cash, but by drawing a cheque upon the Bank of
England, just as an ordinary individual redeems his
liability by handing to his creditor a draft on his
bank. If they both bank at the same bank the
necessary adjustments are made in the books of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
bank. The aggregate deposits of the bank are
unaffected, and the reserve is unaffected.</p>

<p>All the joint stock banks, then, have accounts
with the Bank of England, and the deposits of the
Bank of England include reserves of the joint stock
banks. The Bank of England pays no interest on
its deposits.</p>

<p>Let us now analyse a Bank of England return,
which we may call a Bank of England balance sheet.
The following return is a post-war return, issued some
months after the outbreak of the <span class="locked">war:—</span></p>

<p>We must leave out of consideration for the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
the Issue Department. This is quite distinct from
the Banking Department, and so far as the Banking
Department is concerned, its working is as independent
as though it were merely a Treasury Office
in Whitehall.</p>

<p>The Proprietors’ Capital explains itself. It represents
the amount of capital subscribed by the
shareholders. The Rest may be regarded as the
Bank’s accumulated profits, and ordinary reserve
fund. It is the fund into which the profits flow and
the funds out of which the dividends are paid. It is
not allowed, however, to run below £3,000,000.</p>

<p>The Public Deposits are the Treasury deposits,
and it will be observed that these are kept distinct
from the Other Deposits. As every return explains,
these deposits include Exchequer, Saving Banks,
Commissioners of National Debt, and Dividend
accounts. When we pay our income tax to the
Government it is paid into the Bank of England and
swells the Public Deposits, and the Government uses
them in the same way as the private individual uses
his deposits in his own bank.</p>

<p>The Other Deposits are the aggregate deposits of
all the Bank of England’s depositors except the
Government. They include the Reserves of the banks
of the Kingdom and the loans the Bank has made to
its various customers. As they include loans they
are a composite account. The Seven Day and Other
Bills is an item of no importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>On the other side are the assets the Bank holds
against these varied liabilities. Government
Securities are securities lodged by the Government as
a security for loans, and they also include the Bank’s
own investments. The Other Securities include bills
of discount, and securities of the highest class lodged
with the Bank as security for the loan-deposits.</p>

<p>The notes are the ordinary Bank of England legal
tender notes, and constitute, with the small amount
of gold and silver coin, the Reserve of the Bank
against its liabilities. In this particular week the
ratio of the Reserve to the liabilities was 32⅛ per
cent.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the Reserve does not consist
of coin, but almost entirely of notes. But the notes
can be exchanged at the Issue Department for gold, so
that they are equivalent to a holding of gold.</p>

<p>On the asset side of the return, then, we see the
character of the wealth the Bank possesses. This
wealth represents the loanable fund of the Bank and
totals a huge sum. The deposits are, of course,
merely book entries, or book liabilities, or credits, as
most call them, and what I call the liquefied form of
the wealth held against them.</p>

<p>Those who borrow the most extensively from the
Bank are bill brokers, and they only borrow in those
seasons when the joint stock banks have reached the
limit imposed by their reserves and cease lending.
Having need of liquid capital and not being in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
position to wait until the joint stock banks can lend
again, it is with great reluctance the bill brokers
borrow from the Bank of England. The reluctance
is most natural, because the Bank of England
charges higher rates for discounting bills and for
lending money on security than the joint stock banks
charge. And it also discounts and lends for much
shorter periods. This explains the Bank rate, which
is of such great importance in the economic life of
the nation. It is the minimum rate at which it will
discount bills for customers and the brokers, while it
will lend only at half per cent. above its minimum
rate for discounting.</p>

<p>The rates charged by the joint stock banks are
always well below Bank rates, except on the rarest of
occasions, and therefore bill brokers and borrowers
of money generally naturally go to the cheapest
market, and when they are forced to go into the
dearest market in Threadneedle Street they go there
from necessity and not from choice.</p>

<p>We are able now to grasp in some measure what
the Central Fund is. The Bank of England, when
other sources are dried up, is always able and willing
to lend <em>at a price</em>. This price is regulated by the
calls upon it, by the state of its reserve, by the condition
of the foreign exchanges, and by a general
survey of financial conditions.</p>

<p>The rate is an instrument for limiting borrowing,
for correcting the foreign exchange, for drawing gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
to England, and for replenishing its reserve, if the
proportion has fallen to what is considered below the
average ratio of prudence, or safety.</p>

<p>The loanable fund of the Bank of England, therefore,
is identical with the loanable fund of what is
called the outside market. It is the highest class of
wealth liquefied, but to the Bank is given the sole
power of attracting gold from abroad as a basis to
this fund when that gold is needed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X"><span id="toclink_88"></span>CHAPTER X<br>

<span class="subhead">THE CENTRAL RESERVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> Central Reserve is the reserve held by the Bank
of England. Not only is it the Central Reserve, but
it must be regarded as the National Reserve, the sole
reserve. This is regarded by many as the chief
weakness of the banking system.</p>

<p>Let us first of all distinguish between reserve and
reserve. This Central Reserve is the national legal
tender reserve. The joint stock banks have other
reserves, as we have seen, composed of the highest
wealth in the kingdom, and though there may be
some reason, there does not appear to me to be the
soundest, deepest reason why the foundation of the
system should be considered unsound because of our
moderate legal tender reserve, dependent as it is
upon independent forces, and because we place minor
importance upon the country’s store of wealth.</p>

<p>To me it would seem the soundest reason to plant
our banking system chiefly upon the solid basis of
wealth, and not let that system be in the capricious
control of a force that has no direct connection with
the country’s real wealth, especially when we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
now found it to be easily possible to meet that most
remote contingency, a national panic. The nation
lives like a parent whose obsession is that in some
far-off day his son may meet with a serious accident
that will affect his brain and make him an imbecile.
What will he do, then, when his son becomes mad?
He broods over the possibility; it darkens his life;
it keeps away joy and happiness; his health suffers;
his energies, mental and physical, become paralysed,
and death gathers him while his son is still in the
prime of healthy manhood.</p>

<p>After all, what panics have we had in this country?
Not one but what has been quickly assuaged since
the banking system developed into its present stage
of soundness.</p>

<p>As it is insisted in many quarters that the system
is far away from being sound enough simply because
we have not large enough gold reserves, we must
examine the national reserve from this point of view.</p>

<p>This reserve is not only the Bank of England’s
reserve against its own liabilities, but is the reserve
against the aggregate liabilities of all the banks of
the kingdom. The joint stock banks, as has been
explained, keep their reserves at the Bank of England,
the gold they keep in their tills and in their strong
rooms being too small to take into serious consideration.</p>

<p>If we take the average fluctuation of the Bank
of England’s reserve to its own liabilities as from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
40 to 50 per cent. throughout the year—this is quite
a fair average variation of the proportion,—we should
probably find that the proportion of this reserve to
the total liabilities of all the banks would be as low
as from 1 to 3 or 4 per cent. This is, of course, a
very low proportion, but low as it is, it has served
us well enough in the past, and as we cannot ignore
experience, it should continue to serve us well in the
future.</p>

<p>When the proportion, say, falls below 40 per
cent., and is approaching 30 per cent., the Bank of
England takes steps to restore it to what is considered
the normal or prudent level.</p>

<p>The proportion, as is inevitable, begins to fall
as borrowers are driven to the Bank of England
when the joint stock banks have ceased giving
accommodation. Though not a single note may
be withdrawn from the reserve the proportion must
necessarily fall as the liabilities rise. But it by no
means always follows that when the proportion
falls from this cause alone the Bank will raise its
rate. This will depend upon general circumstances.
There will be no need for the step if general circumstances
are favourable, for the loan-deposits will in
time be paid off and the normal conditions of the
market will be restored.</p>

<p>As a fact, nothing is more familiar and certain in
Lombard Street than these recurring phenomena.
At the end of quarters, especially the March quarter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
when the taxes are flowing into the Exchequer,
there is a considerable amount of borrowing from the
Bank of England. When the money flows back into
the market through Treasury disbursements, the
borrowers are able to repay their loans to the Bank.</p>

<p>In these times we see the Bank’s liabilities grow
in twofold fashion. The Public Deposits grow owing
to the tax-ingathering, and the Other Deposits grow
because of the borrowing on the part of what is called
the outside market. At the same time, a counter-active
influence is at work. As the taxes are paid in
to the Government they come indirectly out of the
Other Deposits, because they come out of the deposits
of the joint stock banks and out of their reserves, so
this puts a check upon the growth of the Other
Deposits.</p>

<p>The Bank of England generally raises its rate
when a large export of gold abroad takes place.
There are two main channels through which gold
flows from the reserve of the Bank of England. The
one channel is that which takes gold into national
circulation, to the provincial banks and to Scotland
and Ireland at certain seasons of the year; and the
other is the channel by which gold is taken to foreign
countries.</p>

<p>The internal drain, as it is called, rarely has any
influence upon the movements of the Bank rate. This
is because gold is known to be in the country, and if
it is not in the Bank’s own reserve, it is practically in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
the total reserves of the other banks, and it will all
return to the central reserve in due course.</p>

<p>A foreign drain of gold arises from quite other
causes. It will arise from a complication of causes.
Gold may be taken from the Bank in order to liquidate
the country’s balance of debt to other countries.
It is a common phenomenon, for instance, to see at
certain seasons of the year large exports of gold to
New York, Egypt, and South America. These exports
are expected, and occasion no surprise. But sometimes
they are supplemented by large unexpected
withdrawals, there and elsewhere.</p>

<p>As an offset to these withdrawals, the Bank can
replenish the reserve by purchases of gold in the
open market. Each week gold comes to London from
South Africa and often from India, and if the Bank
can buy this gold it may obviate the necessity of
raising the Bank rate. Sometimes, however, there
is keen competition for these arrivals of gold, keen
competition from the Continent or New York, and the
Bank may be unable to outbid its competitors.</p>

<p>The Bank is bound to take all gold offered to it
at the statutory price of 77<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per ounce. But
competition will sometimes drive the price well
beyond this figure, and continental countries sometimes
buy the gold at a loss, as Germany did in 1914,
if they are determined to have it at any price.</p>

<p>For many months before the outbreak of the war,
the competition was exceedingly keen, so keen that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
for a long period the Bank of England was unable to
purchase an ounce of gold. This competition was
chiefly on the part of Germany and Russia, especially
Germany, thereby affording presumptive evidence of
her deliberate plans for war. But this competition
and buying must be regarded as abnormal.</p>

<p>The normal buying and the normal competition
arise when gold is wanted in the normal course of
trading between different countries. If, for instance,
the New York exchange is driven down to such a
point that it is cheaper to send gold than to buy
drafts, or exchange, then gold is bought and shipped.
This applies equally when other exchanges are against
this country.</p>

<p>Sometimes we can spare the gold so well, that it
is better to let it go than to keep it; which proves
the futility of having a greater mass of gold in the
country than the country needs. At other times we
may have too little, and cannot spare more, and it is
at such times that another kind of competition starts:
the competition of bank rates in the various European
centres.</p>

<p>The object of raising the Bank rate is to raise
interest here. When the rate is advanced, the joint
stock banks immediately raise the interest they give
on their deposits, and the rate of discount simultaneously
rises. The latter, however, is not always
instantaneously responsive, for the rise in the Bank
rate may have been foreseen for some time, and rates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
may have risen already in anticipation. It is often
possible to judge, in the light of experience, when the
Bank rate will be raised.</p>

<p>The competition takes the form, therefore, of
raising rates of interest; in other words, of making
money more remunerative here than elsewhere. The
Continent will probably send gold here, or keep gold
here in order to earn the higher interest, especially in
discounting bills, and therefore the export of gold may
be stopped, and gold, at the same time, attracted here.</p>

<p>It does not follow that this is the inevitable consequence.
This will depend, not entirely upon conditions
here, but may be ruled by conditions elsewhere. There
is no hard and fast rule, no sure working of the law
of cause and effect. If other countries are determined
to have the gold, they will take it, no matter how
high the rate may be raised here, and in latter years
the rate has not been so effective, probably, as in
former years.</p>

<p>Whether it be effective or ineffective at given
moments, it is one means we possess—some call
it a weapon—of trying to replenish our national
reserve from other centres, and of increasing the
power of the Bank to buy gold in the open market.</p>

<p>We do not like the reserve to run down too low,
because we fancy that a low reserve would create too
much nervousness in the financial community. We
do not imagine it would create a panic, but it may
prevent undue nervousness should the Bank take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
measures to stop the drain. If gold flows here, it
will in course of time make bank, or market money,
more plentiful and cheap.</p>

<p>At the same time, of course, the trade of the
country is necessarily penalized. It is not good for
trade that there should be frequent fluctuations in the
price of loans. It affects profits, the growth of capital,
and prices, and it also affects the employment of
labour. If too much has to be paid for bank loans,
then it becomes too dear a process to convert fixed
wealth into liquid capital, for users of capital may
not then be able to employ it remuneratively. And
this may be a precursor to trade depression and
stagnation.</p>

<p>If at such times we could replenish the reserves
from the provision of other legal tender, it might
obviate it.</p>

<p>If money be sent here for investment at the
higher rates of interest, it will increase the Bank’s
reserve and at the same time increase the supply of
money. As the supply of money from the joint stock
banks is dependent upon these gold reserves, their
gold reserves will be increased. For some of this
fresh gold will find its way to the banks. They can
then convert more wealth into currency, and thereby
stimulate trade.</p>

<p>When foreigners invest their money here, they
earn their profits in the same way as our banks do.
Their profits are a portion of the general wealth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
the community. As profits can come only from the
production and consumption of wealth, and not from
the void, then they are a portion of that wealth. And
if profits are a constituent of wealth, even if we call
them a residue of wealth, then bank profits must come
from the same source, and not from space.</p>

<p>Foreign banks, therefore, become possessed of a
part of this country’s wealth, for profits are purchasing
power, and purchasing power cannot be intangible; it
cannot be credit. In the same way, when we invest
money in a foreign country—say, Argentina—we receive
the interest in the shape of commodities, that is,
in the shape of the country’s wealth. They are this
country’s profits on that loan: something tangible,
something Argentina and her wealth-producers part
with, and something they would retain if they did
not send it here.</p>

<p>Therefore the interest we pay on foreign loans
here must also be paid in wealth. And if foreign
bankers get their profit in the shape of wealth, so
must our bankers get their profits in the same
substance.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FIDUCIARY CURRENCY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> speaking of the fiduciary currency of the country
I will confine myself for the moment to that portion
of it represented by Bank of England notes. The
war-emergency Treasury note currency I will deal
with later on.</p>

<p>All countries have a fiduciary paper currency.
Some have a convertible currency, others an inconvertible,
and others a partially convertible; but the
dimensions of this treatise cannot be expanded by a
comparison of the systems of different countries.
Those who desire to be assisted by comparisons must
consult other works.</p>

<p>Moreover, I wish to confine myself to our own
fiduciary currency since the Bank Charter Act of
1844. Prior to then the banks of this country were
permitted to issue their own notes, and to issue them
in unlimited quantities, with the provision that they
were payable in gold on demand.</p>

<p>There were people who attributed the various
crises that occurred in different periods prior to 1844
to the over-issue of these notes. It was contended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
that this alleged over-issue brought about an inflation
of the currency and encouraged gambling and speculation.
Diverse views were held then, and diverse
views are likely always to be held, as to the true
origins and causes of financial crises. But whatever
the views or causes may be there can be little doubt,
human nature being what it is, that many joint stock
banks abused the powers with which they were
endowed. This privilege of issuing notes to an
unlimited amount is a dangerous privilege to give to
irresponsible institutions, and if the power be given
it must be given to responsible institutions or one
responsible institution.</p>

<p>This view probably was chiefly responsible for the
Bank Charter Act of 1844. This Act provided that
the Issue Department of the Bank of England should
be separated forthwith from the Banking Department.
Securities to the value of £14,000,000, which
included the Government’s debt to the Bank, were to
be transferred to the Issue Department, together with
so much coin and bullion that the total so transferred
should equal the amount of notes then outstanding.
Notes could be demanded from the Issue Department
by any person in exchange for gold at the rate of
£3 17<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per standard ounce.</p>

<p>It was further enacted that if any banker, having
the power of issue on May 6, 1844, should relinquish
such issue, the Issue Department should be authorized
to increase its issue of notes against securities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
to the extent of two-thirds of the relinquished
issue.</p>

<p>Bankers having the right to issue their own notes
on May 6, 1844, were allowed to continue the issue
under certain conditions, and to an agreed amount;
but no provision was made compelling them to keep
any reserve against their issues either in cash or
securities. Should any issue lapse from any cause,
it could not be restored, and no institutions were
allowed to acquire the right of issue in the future.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the fixing of £14,000,000 as
the basis of the note issue against securities, and not
against gold, was a purely arbitrary sum. No matter
how it was arrived at, nothing will alter its arbitrariness,
and up to the present there has been no suspicion
of ill, uneconomic results from this arbitrary
figure. And being an arbitrary figure there seems
to be no overwhelmingly strong reason why it should
not be extended within judicious limits. We must
bear in mind that in 1844 national and international
commerce were not on the mighty scale they are now.
We must bear in mind that the population of this
country and its output of wealth were greatly less
than they are now, and greatly less than they will be
in the future, and if this arbitrary figure was
judicious and safe in the first half of the nineteenth
century, and in the second half too, a higher figure
should be equally as judicious and safe half a century
hence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>When we deal with a currency system in an
arbitrary manner and control its workings in an
arbitrary way, it is opposed to a scientific way. A
scientific method may be an impossible method in a
delicate system like currency, and therefore, if we
must rely upon arbitrariness, this method can be
made elastic and adjustable in a cautious, judicious
way.</p>

<p>In 1844 banking was in its infancy. It has grown
since then, but we cannot with assurance predict
what developments are ahead of it, and fifty years
hence the nation may look back upon the present
system in much the same way as we look back to
conditions half a century ago. We find that during
the past fifty or sixty years the currency system of
the country has gone through a tremendous metamorphosis.
The banknote system—excepting the
legal tender notes—has practically disappeared, and
another paper currency has taken its place.</p>

<p>This is the cheque currency, the real currency of
the country, because it is representative of the wealth
of the country, as currency should be. It grows
with the country’s wealth and shrinks with the
country’s wealth, and this is precisely the automatic
function an ideal currency should perform. A
perfect currency should simultaneously expand and
contract with the output and exchange of wealth,
because a perfect currency should be that wealth in
liquid form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>Let us for a moment examine what wealth is.
Wealth has been defined by many economists, and
the definitions and formulas have differed greatly.
But we can be more in agreement, perhaps, as to
how wealth actually comes into existence. Wealth
is the product of two forces, and it cannot come into
existence unless these forces interact. These forces
are production and consumption. Wealth is not the
product of production only, nor of consumption only.
We cannot consume what has not come into existence,
what has not been produced. We can produce
without consumption, but it is consumption that
converts it into wealth.</p>

<p>Articles of merchandise and raw materials are
produced in order that they may be consumed. They
would not be produced if there were no prospect of
consumption. It is consumption that confers value
upon products. If products were not converted into
wealth they would perish; they would be valueless.
There must be a desire for them. If there were no
desire for them, labour and capital would not be
spent upon consuming them. A desire must exist
before production, or production must bring a desire
into being. And when that desire becomes active, as
distinct from passive, its activity becomes consumption.
We know that in states of trade depression the
markets are stocked with unconsumed and unconsumable
commodities, and these commodities cannot,
in the strict sense of the idea, be called wealth. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
are perishing, they are valueless, because no one
wants them, and vendors of these commodities face
loss and sometimes ruin. They try every art known
to them to stimulate desire for them in order to get
that desire manifested in purchasing them.</p>

<p>To increase wealth we must necessarily increase
production and consumption; in other words, increase
supply and demand. This is the economic object of
all civilized nations. This wealth it is their object
to convert into money, for money is the reproductive
product of wealth. Wealth cannot become reproductive,
except in a most limited sense, unless it is
converted into reproductive form, and banks supply
not the entire, but the chief machinery for changing
it into this form. If, therefore, their chief function
is to change wealth into reproductive form, it is not
creating credit.</p>

<p>Money is like the fruit ripened into seed. Fruits
of the earth must be ripened into seed before they
can reproduce their kind. If they perish before then,
they do not become reproductive. When this new
seed is sown in the earth, to be gathered into ripened
fruit at the next harvest, it performs the same function
that money performs when it circulates. It reproduces
and multiplies itself, and the harvest springing
up from it is new wealth.</p>

<p>The more wealth, therefore, that is transformed
and reproduced and that multiplies, the richer, we
say, a country becomes. Therefore, it follows that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
the transforming machinery should work with pace
equalling the creation of wealth if the country is to
reap the best harvests from its work. For every
pound’s worth of wealth coming into existence the
means should be provided for transforming it into
a pound’s worth of money.</p>

<p>So far, the best means discovered is the cheque
system. No legal tender system, based upon gold,
could provide these essential means, because gold is
not provided sufficiently, and cannot be provided sufficiently.
The machinery we need can be made with
no precious metal. If we desire perfect machinery,
it is indisputable that no machinery could do the
work so efficiently as paper machinery.</p>

<p>The paper currency system is, therefore, a great
advance upon the old banknote system. It is transformed
wealth, and as the cheques represent the
deposits, rising and falling in amount with them,
then the deposits must be transformed, reproducible
wealth. The note system, based on no wealth, was
credit.</p>

<p>Returning to the Issue Department of the Bank
of England, we see that £11,015,100 of the total note
issue is based upon the sum of money owing by the
Government to the Bank, and that £7,434,000 is
based upon other securities of a gilt-edged order,
making a total of £18,450,000. The balance is based
pound for pound on gold.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that if every note was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
presented to the Bank to be converted into gold, over
£18,000,000 of these notes could not be converted.
Some have suggested that in that event, in order to
provide the gold, the securities could be sold for
gold, the Government debt could be converted into
bonds, and they also could be sold. But as this need
could arise only in a panic, when every one clamoured
for gold, and all who had securities were trying to
sell them for gold, the Bank of England would find
it impracticable to sell securities for gold. Such
securities, if they are to be sold at all, must be sold
at other times, and the gold must be acquired then
if the note issue is to be made absolutely convertible.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the need is too remote, too
much in the realm of dreams, to be entertained
gravely. The gold could perform better services to
the community than to be hoarded in this fashion.</p>

<p>Since the year of the Bank Charter Act we have
had three serious panics in the country. Now the
Act was passed to prevent panics. As it did not
prevent panics, the theories on which the legislation
was based proved untenable.</p>

<p>Panics are not automatic. It was probably thought
by many that they were, and that they could be ended
in automatic fashion. It is impossible to foresee how
a panic will arise. According to every plausible
theory, a panic should surely have been the immediate
consequence of the European War. Not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
should a panic have arisen then, but it should have
been by far the worst panic this country has ever
faced. But no panic resulted, and all plausible
theories have been inoperative.</p>

<p>Previous panics have been allayed by the actual
suspension, or by the potential suspension, of the
Bank Act. That is to say, by the knowledge that
the Bank of England would have power to issue note
currency to any amount, unbacked by the deposit of
gold. In other words, by the knowledge that sufficient
legal tender would be provided, <em>at a price</em>, for the
needs of all solvent people.</p>

<p>The need, then, is currency—just as a person
prostrated by fever needs a tonic to restore him to
convalescence. When the need is rightly met, all
is well. To withhold the remedy would feed the
disease. Instead of being checked, the disease would
grow.</p>

<p>Panic is a disease of the mind, and it most often
proceeds, like disease of the body, from excessive
indulgence in a disease-producing cause. It will
suddenly arise as an offspring of wild gambling and
frenzied speculation, and it will infect people in a
healthy condition who fear they will be victims of
the scourge. And it is not only the duty of the State,
but the highest wisdom of the State, to come to the
help of the healthy.</p>

<p>We have seen how the State has performed this
duty in the past, in the days when banking was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
immature, and we have seen how it has performed
its duty, with perfect and instantaneous success, when
the country became involved in the greatest crisis it
has ever faced. And this is an experience from which,
it seems to me, valuable lessons may be learnt.</p>

<span class="subhead">BANKING WEALTH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Having</span> proceeded so far we may now be able to test,
perhaps, with more sureness the kind of wealth a
bank does transform, and the kind of wealth it should
transform. On the character of the wealth sound
banking should depend.</p>

<p>Wealth has degrees. There is the highest wealth
and the lowest wealth, with infinite degrees between.
How are we to distinguish the highest from the lowest
wealth, to know the quality of that product which
comes into being from the satisfaction of desire? I
think it is <em>time</em> that will enable us to judge. That is
to say, wealth is to be judged by its enduring qualities.
The highest wealth is permanent, or lasting
wealth; the lowest is fleeting, or transient wealth.</p>

<p>The most permanent wealth is food and air,
because without this wealth humanity would perish,
and banking systems with it. But air cannot be
transformed, from reasons well known; but food can,
and food satisfies the most lasting of human desires.
Only universal death can destroy that desire.</p>

<p>Let us examine with closer scrutiny the typical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
bank balance sheet given in a former chapter. First
of all comes gold. Now we regard gold as the most
permanent form of economic wealth. What alone
gives it this permanency is the law. It is not inherently
permanent; inherently, it is no more permanent
than are diamonds or corals. We know that
the quantity of gold in the earth is limited, and that
gold is perishable, and that it cannot be got below
certain depths, because men cannot live beyond those
depths. The time will come when gold will be exhausted,
and it will then be necessary to find another
substance to perform the functions allotted to it. As
law has made it permanent wealth, so law could
to-morrow, by its arbitrary decree, make it impermanent
wealth. If gold were allowed to be, like
diamonds, a mere commodity, then it would come in
a low degree of wealth.</p>

<p>It is important, therefore, to be conscious of the
arbitrary power that makes this low degree of wealth
permanent wealth. Because law has decreed that it
shall be in the highest class of wealth, then it comes
first amongst a bank’s assets, because this is the
class of wealth that in certain circumstances would
have to satisfy the strongest of human desires. Is
it the wealth that a bank transforms? It is transformed,
because though it lies in a bank’s vaults, it
is transformed into the same substance as other
wealth and thereby becomes fruitful. In this manner
it is able to multiply itself, not into gold, but into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
other forms of wealth. It multiplies itself into gold
indirectly by stimulating and helping the production
of it. When gold is brought to the Bank of England
and converted into notes, it performs the same services
as when it is taken to banks and is converted
into that other form of paper currency, cheques.
The gold gets into circulation, and is just as fruitful
though it be circulated in the form of coin, instead
of notes. It makes no difference whether this gold
is retained in the vaults of the joint stock banks, or
is placed in the keeping of the Bank of England. In
fact, if it is placed in the keeping of the Bank of
England, it can be made more fruitful, for the Bank
of England re-utilizes it, and increases the potential
amount of currency based upon it.</p>

<p>The next asset is the money at call and short
notice. The money at call is, as already explained,
practically the money lent to bill brokers, and forms
a part of what is called a bank’s liquid reserve. If
in a time of grave urgency the bank “calls” this
money from the bill brokers, it simultaneously “calls”
in its loan deposits. It is understood that in those
moments the brokers would be unable to repay their
loans if they could not get the money from the banks.
If, therefore, they cannot get the money from the
banks, how can this portion of the deposits be withdrawable
from the banks? If they were withdrawn,
they would have to be paid in again the moment
they were withdrawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>We know that in those times, however, the loans
would be called and the bill-brokers would have to
borrow the money from the Bank of England. And
this money being paid over to the creditor bank, the
deposits would automatically fall, and the proportion
of the gold reserve to the other deposits would automatically
rise.</p>

<p>It is a conviction in Lombard Street that in those
times the bill-brokers could get no money from the
joint stock banks. That being so, what is called the
credit superstructure does not appear to be so unwieldy
as it looks.</p>

<p>The money at short notice presumably represents
the money lent to the Stock Exchange at settlement
times. Those to whom the money is lent owe the
money to the bank, and when the bank asks for
repayment the money must be got elsewhere, and it
can only be got from the Bank of England on a
certain class of security. Against these two classes
of loans, security is lodged with the lending bank.</p>

<p>What class of wealth is this? The security for
the money at call is of a higher class than the security
for the money at short notice. The latter security
consists of all kinds of Stock Exchange securities.
The most fleeting kind of wealth we may call the
wealth brought into existence by speculation. It is
nevertheless wealth, for it satisfies a desire and is
exchanged. But as this desire is quickly destroyed,
then the wealth is either totally destroyed or partially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
destroyed with it. Even war produces wealth, but
as this wealth satisfies only a fleeting desire its reproductive
power is transient. It is like scattering
seed on the rocky ground, little of which is able to
take deep root. The harvest is scanty, and like all
scanty harvests, it brings want and ruin in its train.
It lessens the reproductive and, therefore, the consumptive
power of labour, and thus directly affects
harvests elsewhere.</p>

<p>Banks, therefore, in selecting the wealth constituted
in Stock Exchange securities must carefully
discriminate between the lasting wealth and the
fleeting wealth; in other words, between high-class
investment securities and speculative stocks and
shares. This, of course, calls for intimate knowledge
and sound judgment. These are qualifications all
bank managers must possess. If they possess the
qualifications and exercise the soundest judgment in
selecting the highest type of wealth, then they put
into practice all the principles of sound banking.</p>

<p>Now, there is no suspicion that these qualifications
are not possessed and that this sound, selective
judgment is not shown by the managers of our great
banking institutions. This, therefore, is the basis of
the community’s confidence in them. That confidence
is justified.</p>

<p>We need not minutely examine the bank’s “investments.”
Not only do these constitute wealth of
the highest class, but it is wealth not represented by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
loans and immediate liabilities. They may justifiably
and safely be placed secondary only to the bank’s
gold, forming a portion of its liquid reserve. In the
hour of danger or peril to the community, it should
be the duty of the Government, should the need arise,
immediately to transform this wealth into legal
tender money.</p>

<p>Bills discounted represent another form of the
highest wealth of the community, and the banks still
adhere to the soundest principles in discounting
them. These bills represent that class of wealth
that has to satisfy the most enduring desires of the
human race. Here, then, we see the best judgment
at work. There are, of course, many varieties of
bills of exchange. They may be placed in different
classes, or categories, according to their endorsements.
What is called in the market the “finest”
bills are those endorsed by the leading banks, and
they are called clearing bank acceptances. Banks
accept these bills for small commissions, and they
are more readily discounted then in the market,
simply because they have behind them the highest
class of wealth. Then there are bills accepted by
merchants and other houses or firms which are not
of the standing of the clearing banks. They are of
an inferior category. The value of the acceptances
and endorsements, and therefore the value of the
bills, depends greatly upon the standing or reputation
of the acceptors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>Now the banks discount, as a rule, only the
“finest” bills, that is, the bills with the most
reliable acceptances, bills accepted, say, by other
banks. In exercising this discrimination they
exercise the soundest judgment, and nothing higher
can be expected of them.</p>

<p>Such bills as these are readily discountable at
the Bank of England, and there is no sound reason
why, in certain given circumstances, they should
not be discounted even by the Government through
the agency of the Bank of England. It might be in
the interests of the country to do this, especially
as the machinery could immediately be set in motion.
And if the machinery could be set in motion immediately,
then the bills should be as good a reserve
as legal tender.</p>

<p>It is to be believed, too, that the soundest judgment
is shown in the selection of the composite
wealth aggregated under loans and advances. These
represent the largest aggregate asset, but, at the
same time, they represent the greatest proportion
of the loan-deposits, deposits repayable to the bank.
Such loans as these should be made of very short
duration, renewable, of course, but renewable for
short periods. Is it possible to make some kind of
legal provision whereby in the event of a remote
disaster such as a panic these deposits, representing
liabilities to a bank, should be discriminated against
and not be withdrawable on demand? Could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
the position be made clearer, as I have hinted
already, by segregating the deposit and current
accounts? Were this hint adopted the amended
balance sheet would appear somewhat as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p>The answer might be that this would look too
modest a balance sheet, and would give less scope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
for boasting of the growth of deposits. The deposits
now look attenuated at less than £9,000,000, but
look at the cash reserve against them! Close on
£6,000,000! True, this cash melts at the Bank of
England, but it gives the balance sheet a truer and
stronger appearance. If it be sincerely desired to
give greater enlightenment to the public, as many
contend, then further enlightenment can be given in
this way, which is by no means the last word in
improving a balance sheet.</p>

<p>But there is too much competition between banks;
too deep a jealousy and too keen a rivalry. This
keen and jealous competition may be well amongst
merchants and tradesmen, but it seems neither
healthy nor dignified amongst banks. The work
they do for the nation is too vital for this kind of
competition to be encouraged. Perhaps it would be
in the best interests of the nation if banks were
nationalized, and made branches of a National Bank.</p>

<p>The main object of banks should not be that of
the ordinary tradesman, who boasts loudly and
sometimes vulgarly of the trade he is doing. There
should be no incitement to this in banking, no incitement
to dilate composite deposits, to swell profits
and to strain dividends. With all this rivalry and
incitement, this desire to gratify shareholders, it is
wonderful how cautiously and soundly managed
banks are. There should be no hesitation to perform
their functions within the limits of prudence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
but, at the same time, there should be no undignified
display and boastfulness. This does not make the
deep impression some imagine. On the contrary, it
tends to generate the suspicion in many prudent minds
that caution and safety are being unduly strained.</p>

<p>The public have not failed to notice that contrary
policies have been adopted by the great banks in
dealing with their profits for the year of crisis, 1914.
Some reduced their dividends and others maintained
them. Some allowed liberally for depreciation, and
others allowed for no depreciation at all. Some
provided for the future, others were content to let
the future take care of itself. And what conclusions
can the public draw from such divided counsels and
irreconcilable policies? Able to agree as they often
are on common policy, they were unable to agree on
so important a policy as this. As one bank manager
said to the writer, when discussing this matter:
“Even if the dividends were earned, it was a matter
of sound expediency in times such as these to reduce
them. It would have strengthened their positions
and at the same time have made a better impression
on the public.” And there was much wisdom in
this view.</p>

<p>Applying, as we have done, severe tests to bank
management, it emerges from them with great credit.
Sound as the management is no bank manager and
no bank directors would be vain enough to claim
that ideal soundness has been attained.</p>

<span class="subhead">ELASTICITY OR INELASTICITY?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">One</span> of the great subjects of controversy, on which it
seems impossible to arrive at a common agreement,
is whether the so-called loanable fund is elastic or
inelastic. It is admitted, I think, in a general sense
that in order best to help the trade of the country, it
should be elastic, that is, should be able to meet all
the needs upon it. This certainly should be the province
of banking, and, what is more, it should be the
province of Governments to provide sufficient money
to meet the expansion of trade. It would be a foolish
policy to shackle and bind trade, to arrest its growth,
by restricting facilities for its growth. It would be
like a foolish parent binding the limbs of his child
to stay their natural growth and to keep him a dwarf
and a freak, unable to do the work of a mature
man.</p>

<p>As the banking system practically performs the
duties which in its non-existence would have to be
performed by a Government, then it devolves upon
this system to feed and succour commerce and to give
it every facility and every means for expansion. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
I said in <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a> that the transforming machinery
should work with a pace equalling the creation of
wealth, it was tantamount to the view expressed by
others that the loanable fund of Lombard Street
should be elastic.</p>

<p>Instead of calling it a loanable fund, a vast pool of
money into which borrowers dip, a pool always filled
by a perennial spring, I prefer to call it machinery
for transforming fixed wealth into mobile capital, or
currency. When I take my wealth to a bank I take
it there because I cannot use it fruitfully as capital in
its fixed form. As I wish to use it fruitfully the bank
temporarily changes it into money for me, and in this
new shape I can make full use of it.</p>

<p>Now, all who have practical experience of the
banking system know there are times when the banks
refuse to perform this office for wealth possessors.
The machinery comes to a temporary stop. When
we inquire why it has stopped, we learn that it is
because the proportion of the reserve to the liabilities
has fallen to too low a point. Others would say, it is
because the pool had been drained too far, was being
dried up, and that time must be given for money to
flow in again. If we liken it to a pool we find that
instead of it having been drained, it is really over-filled,
and that what the banks desire to do is to stop
the overflow and to let the water sink. The banks
say they have lent too much, and must now lend no
more for awhile; so they not only stop lending, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
call in loans, which again shows that the fund is
overflowing; it must be allowed to subside.</p>

<p>We also see at times, when the fund is overflowing,
that banks are so eager to lend, that money is said to
be a glut on the market and exceedingly cheap. It is
offered at nominal rates of interest. Why, then, are
there times when banks are eager to lend when the
fund is supposed to be overflowing, and times when,
with an overflowing fund, they refuse to lend? Why
is it that at times when the fund is low they are
willing to lend, and why at other times when the
fund is low they are unwilling to lend?</p>

<p>These phenomena prove, I think, that it is not a
fund of money in the real sense of the word. We can
never tell merely by looking at the aggregate deposits
of the banks whether they are able to lend at any
given moment or not. We can easily delude ourselves
by looking at the bulk of that fund. What governs
what we may call the transforming capacity of banks
is the quantity of gold they individually possess and
general financial and international conditions. In
times of uncertainty and apprehension, no matter
from what circumstances or events these arise, banks
may refuse to lend, no matter what the condition of
the so-called loan fund may be. So far from lending
when their deposits appear to be very high, they are
anxious to diminish these deposits and gather in gold.</p>

<p>It follows that the more gold they hoard the less
becomes the loanable fund. Therefore the more legal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
tender they accumulate at these times, the less money
they lend. Which seems anomalous and paradoxical.
The more money banks have at certain times the less
they have. When the hour of nervousness passes
they begin to lend again. The money in the shape of
gold diminishes in proportionate quantity, therefore
the loanable fund of Lombard Street apparently
increases as gold apparently diminishes.</p>

<p>This fund is, at times, like a spring in a desert.
The thirsty traveller sees it shimmering in the distance
and hurries towards it in profound gratitude,
thankful that his thirst is to be slaked and his sufferings
are to be relieved at last. But just as he is
about to put his lips to the tempting waters, a voice
of warning stops him. He is not to drink, for the
waters are too precious and must be preserved. Not
a drop can be spared. So he does not slake his thirst,
and perhaps afterwards succumbs to the torture he is
suffering.</p>

<p>The spring is there, but he is forbidden to drink!</p>

<p>In the banks the source of money is there, but the
gold must be preserved, and the community must
depart unsatisfied, no matter what the consequences
may be. The banks will not lend because they must
keep and increase, not their deposits, their so-called
loanable fund, but their gold.</p>

<p>These deposits, then, are not strictly a loanable fund,
otherwise the more they grew the greater would be
the fund. In fact, the fund would be inexhaustible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
increased and not diminished by the demands made
upon it. We know they are increased by loans.
Therefore the best means of increasing the fund
would be by increasing the loans, and we could then
witness money actually piling up mountain-high in
our midst. This could put all fables of money-making
by magic into the shade.</p>

<p>Instead, however, of increasing the fund by lending
as fast as physical resources will permit, the
banks adopt the contrary policy. They stop making
loans and simultaneously diminish the loans they
have already made.</p>

<p>Whatever views the public may hold, bankers
labour under no delusions as to the real nature of
the loan-fund. They know well enough they do
not lend out of that fund at all, for if they lent
out of it they would inordinately increase it by
lending and so make more profit. It helps to shed
more light on the nature of the deposits. Why are
banks anxious to diminish the deposits in times of
anxiety and apprehension? That is to say, the loan
deposits, and not the pure deposits? Why are they
anxious to diminish the aggregate of the so-called
money fund?</p>

<p>They wish to take away from their borrowers their
power to withdraw, even temporarily, gold. If they
take this power from them the banks know they will
be in a far stronger position, even should the deposits
diminish by fifty per cent. In their own language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
bankers say: “We must strengthen our cash position.”
This means, then, that the cash fund and the
deposit fund are not one and the same thing. The
cash fund is strengthened by weakening the deposit
fund. Cash grows as the loanable fund falls.</p>

<p>If the loan deposits are thereby greatly diminished
until the deposits are mainly what I have called pure
deposits, it shows how the banks safeguard themselves
when they think danger is coming. Their
assets change. Gold takes the place of other wealth,
and the banks are able the better to meet a run on
the part of their depositors. They have automatically
met the danger from the presence of the loan-deposits,
and now they have only to face the danger
from the pure deposits. They have fortified themselves
for this by differentiating between the characters
of their deposits, which in their aggregate
are misleadingly called the loan fund of Lombard
Street. The gold is the real lending fund.</p>

<p>This is done, too, often at a time most unfortunate
for the general community. It is done at a
time when the community should receive more and
not less help from the banks. Banks ought to lend
more freely in times of crisis than at other times,
for it is that freer lending that will help the country
to meet and get through the crisis. To stay help, to
withdraw help already given, is to increase the difficulties
of the general community, to feed alarm and
apprehension, to aggravate the crisis. The banks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
do, therefore, what seems wise, perhaps, for them,
but unwise for the community.</p>

<p>They are not to be blamed so severely as some
imagine. They have to look to the law in the same
way as the individual has to look at it, and they
cannot be blamed for acting in accordance with law.
It is, perhaps, the law that is unwise and not the
banks. Communities must abide by the laws they
make, and by the limited freedom laws allow. Laws
are not the last word in human wisdom. Laws can
be modified and improved upon.</p>

<p>Banks have to work within restrictions imposed
upon them by the law, and if these restrictions become
harsh in times of difficulty and crisis, then it
is the law that is at fault and not the banks.</p>

<p>Banks must pay out legal tender to their depositors
on demand. The Government restricts the supply
of legal tender by enacting that gold alone shall be
legal tender. Therefore the Government is not
irresponsible for the manner in which the machinery
works in all sorts of conditions.</p>

<p>If the supply of legal tender is restricted, no banking
system, or any system like it, would be possible
if the reserves in legal tender had to be equal, or
nearly equal, to the deposits. If the banking system
is to be worked in the highest interests of the community,
then the gold reserves must necessarily be
greatly less than the deposits. If the people of this
country took to hoarding gold, then the banking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
system would eventually come to a stop, which shows
again what the nature of the loan fund is. There
can be no loan fund without gold, and in that case
there could be no currency such as the cheque system
of this country.</p>

<p>Ought we, then, to reform and modify the law?
I can imagine the time coming when legal tender
will not be confined to gold. But this is far distant.
I think reform can come in the manner in which we
have experienced it since the war. The Government
could ensure free working in times of apprehension
and crisis in the manner in which it ensured it in
August, 1914, by the creation of emergency currency.
What can be done successfully and beneficially once
can be done again.</p>

<p>If there are times and occasions when banks stop
lending and when they call in their loans, then it
follows, reverting to market parlance, that the loan-fund
is inelastic. If it cannot always and invariably
respond to needs, then it cannot conform itself to
varying conditions and circumstances. This fact,
therefore, supports the contentions of those who say
that the fund is inelastic. In my way I say the
machinery is far from perfect. It always works with
difficulty at the very time when it should work with
ease. It will come to a dead stop at the moment
when it should be working at high pressure.</p>

<p>To make the position clearer I will recall what
Mr. A.&nbsp;C. Cole said in his controversy with Mr. Tritton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>“I entirely disagree,” he said, “as to the inelasticity
of this fund. My view is that the inelasticity
is apparent, but not real. By this I mean that
it is inelastic at any given moment because, in these
days of competition, bankers lend all their available
surpluses; but to say that the short loan fund is
permanently elastic is quite beside the mark. What
does inelasticity of the market mean? It means the
want of power of the market to adjust itself to
pressure or tension. Now, take the discount market.
The supply of money always adjusts itself to the
demand. Except in times of panic, good bills are
always discountable in London. This Mr. Tritton
practically admits in his paper. As regards the
large amounts of Treasury bills, Exchequer bonds,
etc., of which there has been a marked increase in
recent years, owing to the [Boer] war, Mr. Tritton
says it is not very clear from what source the funds
so invested have arisen. This gives away his case,
for it is an admission that the money has been forthcoming.
In other words, the supply in the short-loan
market has been increased because the demands
upon it have been larger, and this will always prove
to be the case. The short-loan market is really
augmented quicker than any other fund. It is quite
immaterial whether the funds belong to owners in
this country or to capitalists abroad. The fact
remains that the money is available when wanted,
or, in other words, the short-loan fund is so elastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
that it promptly adjusts itself to the demands upon
it, though temporary recourse to the Bank of England
may be necessary, while the adjustments take
place. The apparent inelasticity of the fund is
evidence of what I may call the efficiency of the
short-loan market. By efficiency I mean that the
total available funds in the market are in constant
use. This is not a bad thing for the community, but
it implies that on the least strain or dislocation of
the machinery of the market, recourse has to be
made to what is then the only available source of
supply—the central institution. But as the Bank of
England is always willing to discount or lend upon
good bills, the supply of money in the market is
never exhausted. It is simply a question (except in
times of panic, which we are not here considering)
of the rate of interest whether the money is forthcoming.”</p>

<p>I cannot agree with Mr. Cole. If he admits that
there is an exception, and the exception works in a
time of panic, at the very moment when it is vital
to the community that the exception should be
removed, then he gives away his case. He admits
that the supply is not inexhaustible, for it suddenly
dries up when the need is greatest. To say that it
is “inelastic at any given moment,” that it is not
permanently inelastic, and that there are times when
borrowers are driven to the Bank of England, is
inconsistent and illogical. If there are moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
when it is inelastic, then it cannot be permanently
elastic.</p>

<p>When soon after the present war complaints were
made that banks were not lending freely, and when
a warning to them came from the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, it furnished further proof of inelasticity
in times of difficulty and pressure.</p>

<p>Let us now examine further the machinery of the
Bank of England and the rate of interest.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV"><span id="toclink_128"></span>CHAPTER XIV<br>

<span class="subhead">EXHAUSTIBILITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">If</span> what is called the loanable fund were perfectly
elastic and “promptly adjusted itself to the demands
upon it,” how is it that the value of money, called
the rate of interest, is not more uniform? It certainly
should be more uniform if it were a fund that
automatically responded to the demands upon it,
increasing as the output of wealth increased, decreasing
when the output of wealth fell off. In a
perfect system this would certainly happen; but
sound as banking may be within its limitations, we
must admit that it is far from being a system of
perfection. The fact that the rate of interest is not
uniform, that it rises and falls in a capricious and
not uniform way, is further proof that the fund is
not, as it should be in a perfect or improved system,
elastic.</p>

<p>Experience shows us clearly that as demand grows
the potential supply diminishes; therefore it cannot
be a perennial, inexhaustible fund. If bankers find
that the demand is growing, they advance their rates
of interest. In other words, they demand a larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
share of the profits of the community. They have
two objects to serve in this. They desire to increase
their own profits and they desire to check the demands
upon them. From their point of view, it is better
to lend a little at a high rate of interest than much
at a low rate. In their annual or semi-annual
speeches bank chairmen are pleased if they can show
their shareholders that during a certain period the
rate of interest has been high; for it is evidence to
them that circumstances have been in their favour;
that they have done good, profitable business. They
lament times when interest has ruled low. And
interest rules low when the fund is said to be overflowing,
when the banks cannot lend as much as they
would like. There are, however, as I have already
pointed out, exceptions to this. It is no invariable
rule, or law, or sequence, whatever we may please to
call it, that interest is low when the fund is overflowing
and high when the fund has fallen. Interest
is governed by many causes extraneous to the power
of banks to lend, and these causes often arise in an
unforeseen, capricious way.</p>

<p>We may say, however, while recognizing the effects
of irregular, uncertain causes, that the value of what
is called bank money is affected by the well-known
law of supply and demand, the law that affects the
prices of commodities and of labour. In a general
sense, when the supply of money is greater than
the demand the rate of interest falls; when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
demand is in excess of the supply the rate of
interest rises.</p>

<p>Demand increases when borrowers multiply.
Borrowers go in growing numbers to the banks. As
the loans thereby increase, so the deposits increase.
If, therefore, the deposits compose the loanable fund,
the loanable fund increases. At last, however, the
loanable grows so large that the banks say they can
lend no more. Lend no more, when the loanable
fund is greater than ever? But the banker shakes
his head. He knows that though the loanable fund
is greater than ever in appearance, it is smaller than
ever in fact. He knows that the greater the demands
made upon him the more his power of lending
decreases, until the moment arrives when he has
to say “Stop!” He sees that as the fund rises the
proportion of the gold reserve falls. So he stops
lending, lets his loans run off, whether secured on
bills of discount or securities, and waits until that
so-called loan-fund falls. And when it has fallen,
when the loan-fund is less, then he can lend again,
although to the uninitiated he has apparently less
to lend.</p>

<p>How, then, does this fund promptly respond to
the demands upon it if the supply of gold flowing into
the banks does not keep pace with those demands?
If the supply of gold, not loan-deposits, kept pace
with the demands then, and then only, could the
fund “promptly adjust itself to the demands upon it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>It is elementary knowledge in Lombard Street
that when the Bank of England is able, week after
week and month after month, to buy up all the
South African and other gold coming into the bullion
market, that it will tend to increase “credit” and
depress loan-rates. We know that the gold will
increase the supply of market money more surely
than the growth in the country’s wealth. This is
because we know the gold will eventually find its
way to the banks, increase their gold reserves, and
enable them to lend more.</p>

<p>It proves, then, that the working of the fund,
elastically or otherwise, is dependent upon the flow
of gold into the Bank of England. This is because
the law has decreed that gold shall be legal tender.
Therefore, the supply of money for the help of
commerce, for the fettered working of the banking
system, is dependent in the ultimate resort upon the
law of the land. It is not dependent in the ultimate
resort upon the law of supply and demand, because
a more powerful law controls the economic law. If
the law, then, controls the supply of money, then the
law must control the supply of wealth, and the law
must control ultimately the prices of labour and of
commodities.</p>

<p>When liquid capital is provided by the banks a
charge is made for it. This rate of interest not only
affects the amount of capital that shall be furnished,
but it must affect the prices of the product that comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
into existence from the use of that capital. If the
merchant has to pay a high price for that capital,
he must ask a higher price for his product, for he
will not use that capital unremuneratively. The
greater the abundance of capital employed in the
country the greater is the quantity of wealth produced,
and the cheaper the capital the lower are the prices
of its products. That is to say, the greater are the
chances of the community partaking of a larger share
of that wealth. If they partake of this larger share
it simultaneously increases the collective, or aggregate,
powers of consumption.</p>

<p>It is indisputable that in times of trade activity
the demands for capital grow. Times of depression
are coincident with a decline in the demand.</p>

<p>In this chapter I am but repeating much of what
I have urged in former chapters, but I am naturally
anxious to make my argument as strong as possible
by the help of wider and, I trust, clearer illustrations
as I proceed. When we travel over a wide tract of
country our vision is too weak to take in all its
topographical features. We can see general features,
but not the minute features which the botanist and
the geologist would examine. The poet would see
what the geologist would not see, and the botanist
would see what would escape the naturalist.</p>

<p>So when we take a survey of the economic and
financial world we see a mechanism which is not the
same when examined minutely as when looked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
from a distance. When we look at it from afar we
cannot see those defects which on close examination
we are able to find.</p>

<p>If rates of interest arbitrarily rise and fall, and
the supply of capital is controlled in an arbitrary
way, the general well-being of the community must
be affected. We suffer when the monopolist takes
advantage of the helplessness of the community to
raise prices. We suffer when shipowners take
advantage of accidental circumstances to raise
freights and the price of food. We suffer when the
colliery proprietors in the depth of winter raise the
price of coal. We suffer also when the banks raise
the rate of interest, thereby raising prices and
affecting employment.</p>

<p>When prices rise, as they have almost uniformly
risen in recent years, many theories are advanced as
to the causes of this. Some attribute it to the
increased output of gold. They mean by this that
the output of gold has increased so greatly that more
money, or more purchasing power, is placed in the
hands of the community. Producers, observing this,
raise the prices of their commodities. If this were
so, the advance in prices would be general, and we
should be no worse or better off than when prices are
low. Wages would inevitably advance if prices were
affected by this universal, not local cause. But it is
asserted that wages have not advanced uniformly,
while tradesmen on their part declare that their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
profits have fallen. Workmen and tradesmen alike
say that they are poorer than they were ten and
twenty years ago, and the housewife declares that a
sovereign now will only go as far as fifteen or ten
shillings went years back.</p>

<p>It is impossible to prove that such a rise is a
consequence of an accelerated production of gold. It
is an hypothesis, and an hypothesis it will remain, for
it ignores a multitude of causes more important in
their aggregate effect than gold.</p>

<p>It does not follow, then, that because at given
moments capital may be dearer than at other
moments, a general rise or a general fall in prices
will immediately follow. Neither can we lay it down
as an indisputable axiom that a 5 per cent. interest,
say, is detrimental to trade, and a 2 per cent. interest
is beneficial to trade. But we can say, I think, that
a very high rate of interest is harmful to trade,
particularly if it be prolonged, and that a constantly
fluctuating rate of interest is more unfavourable for
trade than a uniform rate, or a rate that varies but
slightly.</p>

<p>A high rate of interest means dearth of capital,
and dearth of capital must affect production and
consumption and the output of wealth, just as a
dearth of seed must affect the coming harvest. The
community, therefore, must necessarily suffer from a
dearth of capital, and as the community is largely
dependent upon the banks for the supply of capital,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
then it follows that it is best for the community that
the supply should be constant, that it should adjust
itself to the demands upon it. If it could do this,
then the rate of interest would tend to greater
uniformity. At any rate, it would not rise and fall
so capriciously as it does do. If it varied it would
vary within narrower compass.</p>

<p>If this could be accomplished, if the supply of
capital were less dependent than it has been and still
is, upon extraneous circumstances, we may see
steadier prices, and perhaps one happy effect would
be less labour difficulties and less strikes. Strikes
are, in many instances, the effect of constantly
fluctuating prices. But the supply and price of
capital would not alone put an end to fluctuating
prices. I merely hint that it might help to correct
those frequent and extreme fluctuations that cause so
much discontentment, and so much envy, and so
much misery.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to speculate what would
happen if the Germans conquered us and took
away our colonies and our goldfields. If Germany
restricted or cut off the supply of gold to this
country, what would happen to our loanable fund?
How would it affect what we call the creation of
credit? How would it affect the supply of capital?
If the law remained as it is, and the banks could get
no more gold reserves, then there would be no loanable
fund and no supply of capital. But the law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
being what it is, the supply of capital is dependent
upon the supply of gold.</p>

<p>Mr. Cole admits that on the <em>least</em> strain, or dislocation
of the machinery of the market, recourse has
to be made to what is then the only available source
of supply, the central institution, where it is simply a
question of the rate of interest whether the money
is forthcoming. After admitting, then, that the
machinery can break down and that then there
can be but one source of supply, that supply can only
be obtained at a higher price. If it is to be obtained
at a higher price, then it is to be obtained at the
general expense of the community. If capitalists will
not pay that higher price, then this is tantamount to
a lessened supply of money. As the Bank of England,
too, will not lend on the same class of wealth that
the other banks will lend on, a vast mass of wealth
is excluded. Therefore a vast mass of wealth cannot
be transformed into liquid capital. If no one will
liquefy this wealth, then the production of liquid
capital must be limited, and that capital must remain
in its fixed form till the other banks restart their
transforming machinery. If this be so, then the
supply even from the Bank of England is not, as
Mr. Cole would have us believe, unrestricted and
illimitable. It is, after all, a restricted supply,
regardless of the entire claims or needs of the community,
for narrower discrimination is practised. The
Bank of England may always be willing to discount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
or lend upon good bills. But there are other bills
of a lower grade than this class of bill, and there
is a vast quantity of wealth that is rejected by the
Bank. If the lending is limited to good bills, and if
the quantity of good bills is limited, then the supply
of money from the Bank must be limited. To say
that the supply is inexhaustible is, therefore, misleading.</p>

<p>We know, too, from experience that when the
Bank has been lending for a time on good bills it
has had at times to check these loans. And in order
to check them it has raised the Bank rate. Why has
it raised the rate? To replenish the supply that is
said to be inexhaustible. Mr. Cole says it could get
that supply from abroad, and therefore the fund
would be replenished inexhaustibly. If, however,
the supply from abroad were checked, as we can
imagine it could be, would the fund be inexhaustible
then? It would be interesting to know if, should the
Bank Act be suspended in certain circumstances,
this would fall in with Mr. Cole’s idea, or conception,
of inexhaustibility. Also if the creation of the
Treasury notes falls in with that idea.</p>

<p>We know, of course, that since the war the Bank
has lent enormous sums of money by discounting
pre-moratorium bills of exchange. This may seem
to furnish proof of the inexhaustibility of the fund.
But while it has been lending it has been simultaneously
receiving gold. There has been no competition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
for the gold from South Africa and elsewhere, and
therefore the Bank has been able to procure it in
the usual way. Then New York has been obliged to
liquidate its indebtedness to us in large amounts of
gold. But with all this, the proportion of the reserve
has kept well below the normal. What would have
happened had the rebellion spread in South Africa,
and had the mines there been closed down indefinitely?</p>

<p>Even as it was, the Bank rate had to be maintained
at an artificially high level compared with
loan and discount rates in the outside market.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE THEORETIC LINE OF SAFETY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> will be clear, I think, from the analyses in the
foregoing chapters that banks have not only a
delicate, but a most difficult task to perform. So
difficult is the task that it is impossible to give
satisfaction to all classes of the community. They
have to give satisfaction to borrowers, to their
depositors, to their shareholders and, at the same
time, to the critics who say they are ever alert and
watchful that they are trading within safe limits.</p>

<p>What critics mean when they talk of safe limits
they would not find it easy themselves to define with
exactness. They know what they mean by sound
principles of banking so far as lending on sound
security goes. They know what they mean when
they say that a bank must not engage in speculation,
and that it must carefully scrutinize every class of
wealth on which it lends. This seems to me a tacit
acknowledgment that banks do not create credit in
the sense that many suppose. It would come nearer
the conception of credit creation if banks were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
allowed to speculate and attempt to create wealth out
of nothing.</p>

<p>These critics lay it down as a first principle that
a bank must have adequate gold reserves. If they
do not have adequate gold reserves they put too great
a strain upon the credit structure. But they cannot
agree, they cannot even dogmatize, as to what an
adequate reserve is. Yet the banks are adjured to
give all the help they can to the trade and commerce
of the country. If they refuse that help they come
in for severe condemnation. They are condemned
by the academic critics and they are criticized by the
traders and criticized by their shareholders, and had
not nature fortunately given bank managers very
thick skins—which thicken daily in the environment
in which they live—they would be deserving objects
of commiseration. As it is, no one pities them, and
in time they become accustomed to an atmosphere
unwarmed by mercy. I have, indeed, met people
who regard bank managers as little removed from
callous brutes, men utterly indifferent to the appeals
of those seeking to make their bit in a highly civilized
community.</p>

<p>After all, the lot of a banker, like a policeman’s,
is a hard one, and he is very roughly handled at
times by friend and foe alike: the friend beseeching
him to look to his reserves, the foe caring for nothing
so long as he can get his loan.</p>

<p>Why does the friend beseech him always to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
an adequate gold reserve? Because the hour may
come, suddenly, swiftly, without warning, when the
phlegmatic Britisher will be in the grip of madness.
The man who has calmly and resolutely faced the
greatest crisis in his life; the man who has laughed
at Zeppelins and air craft, whose courage has risen
with his danger, is in a moment, in the twinkling of
an eye, to lose his reason and go amok amongst the
banks of the country, smashing everything in ungovernable
fury. There will be no restraining him
in that mad hour. No force will be powerful enough
to bind him. He will wreck, and the populace will
gaze on helplessly, until all are buried beneath the
ruins of a once beautiful and mighty fabric.</p>

<p>It is because we fear this mad Samson will pull
down the pillars, that we would make those pillars
too strong even for his mighty strength. He would
strain himself against them in vain. They would
defy even the supernatural strength of madness.</p>

<p>It is feared that the reserves will not be large
enough to meet an outbreak of panic. As the
banks are bound by law to repay deposits in gold, or
legal tender, if they have insufficient gold or legal
tender, they will come to smash. And if one great
bank falls, all will fall. The mighty structure will
then be a heap of ruins.</p>

<p>Let us, then, assume that some day, we know not
when, it may be to-morrow or it may be generations
after we are dead and forgotten, a panic <em>may</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
come. It is said that the panic will surely be
hastened if the highly-strung, emotional, fear-stricken
Briton <em>thinks</em> the gold reserve is falling too low. He
may never know for certain whether or not it is too
low. But in some unfortunate moment, when,
perhaps, he is a little out of sorts, he may <em>think</em> it
is too low, and then it will be too late. Without
staying to reason, without staying even to consider
whether his disorder is physical or mental, or whether
a sluggish liver has blurred his vision, he is at the
bank doors before the maid has had time to bring
in his breakfast. And when his mighty fists smash
at those doors the doom of the nation has come.</p>

<p>What it is necessary to do, therefore, is to calm
this nervous gentleman; to talk confidently and
assuringly to him, to talk about politics, philosophy,
poetry, the arts, anything but banking and bank
reserves, and then when he is smiling to take him
out and give him a good lunch.</p>

<p>This is John Bull as some people picture him.
It may be a caricature, and John may resent it as a
libel upon his traits and temperament, but we must
accept it as a serious fact that some people have no
faith in John Bull’s common sense.</p>

<p>Regarding John, therefore, as a highly nervous
old gentleman, who can never rest because of that
bank balance of his, wondering day and night
whether it is safe or not, and spoiling the peace of
the household by his restlessness, what we must try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
to do is to convince the old man that his bank
balance is perfectly safe. It may seem difficult to
do this when we tell him that the bank has only £15
left of his £100; but it might be equally as difficult
to set his mind at rest if we tell him that the bank
has only £40 of the £100, for he will want to know
where the other £60 is. Even £60 is more than
John can afford to lose.</p>

<p>Well, all that we wiseacres must do now is to
have a little confab together and agree upon the
amount we shall tell him the bank actually has
intact of his £100. Perhaps we shall agree that
£15 is much too little. Perhaps to some £20 may
appear to be insufficient. After talking it over and
diagnosing in the most up-to-date scientific fashion
John’s nervous temperament, we agree that his
nervous system can be made quite normal, as normal
as our own, if we say the bank has £30 of his £100,
or nearly one-third.</p>

<p>Thanks, then, to scientific calculation we have
settled this problem. John will be immune now
from nervous disorders, he will be able to sleep
calmly o’ nights, and will settle down into a nice,
comfortable, affable old party, a perfect husband,
and an indulgent parent, feeling that nothing now
is wanting in the best of all possible banking worlds.
Great mathematicians have assured him that the
banks will never fail now they have £30 of his £100
in solid gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>How agreeable it would be if we could settle
this matter in a scientific way, calculating with
mathematical precision how much strain the banking
system will stand, and to a nicety what proportion
of the reserve to the liabilities will for ever
avert a panic. Unfortunately, mathematics will not
help us in this. If we could only lay down a
theoretic line of safety, knowing precisely how far
to go and where to stop, how happy and contented
we could be. The Philosopher’s Stone could perform
no greater miracle. The banks would then know
exactly how much to lend, exactly how much
deposits to receive, irrespective of gold production
and wealth production, and the trade and commerce
of this country could be governed perfectly in true
keeping with our needs and the progress of civilization
by that ideal law, rule-o’-thumb. It would be
impossible to imagine then to what heights of greatness
England would rise, or the reposeful content in
which she would live. As, however, scientific precision
is impossible, we must rule out this haphazard law.</p>

<p>We must still trust as well as we can to experience.
So far experience has not failed us. This
much can be said in its favour.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say what proportion of reserve
will save banks in a possible panic. Perhaps eighty
or ninety per cent, would not save them. Perhaps
they might go under with a thirty per cent. proportion,
when a thirty-one per cent. would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
averted the disaster. Nor must we rule out of
consideration when contemplating the theoretic line
of safety the composite character of the deposits.</p>

<p>Banks are counselled to adopt two extreme
policies. That is to say, to do the impossible. They
are asked to lend freely to assist trade, and at the
same time are asked not to lend or to lend sparely.
During the early weeks of the war, for instance,
they were urged to give liberal assistance to commercial
men and others, and at the same time to
increase their reserves and to be ultra-cautious.</p>

<p>Some critics, and the most distinguished amongst
them is Mr. Walter Bagehot, urge them always to
keep high reserves against the day of panic, and yet
when the panic comes to lend freely. They cannot
lend freely and simultaneously maintain high
reserves. They cannot have high and low reserves
at one and the same time. They cannot lend
sparingly and cautiously in the same moment as
they lend liberally and incautiously. They must
either keep high reserves and assist commerce as
sparingly as possible, or they must keep modest
reserves and help commerce as liberally as possible.
They cannot adopt contrary policies.</p>

<p>What should we say of the farmer who kept his
seed in the barn and feared to sow it to-day lest a
storm should arise to-morrow and destroy it? He
must take his chances of a storm. And the country
must take its chances of a panic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>But the chances are not so fearful as some
imagine. Quite apart from psychological considerations,
there is the country itself, the Government,
behind the banking system. The country, the
Government, cannot afford to see that system come
to ruin. It is not as if the Government would be
helpless. The Government has the power, and it
should use the power to prevent the ruin. Moreover,
it is the duty of the Government to prevent it.</p>

<p>It is the Government’s duty because the Government
does not allow free banking in this country.
This may seem a startling assertion. Let us
examine it.</p>

<p>If the Government enacts that gold shall be legal
tender, and that banking deposits must be repaid on
demand in their entirety in legal tender, then banking
is fettered by law. It is not free banking in the
full sense of the term. If banking is fettered by the
capricious output of gold, it is not free banking; and
if the commerce of the country is fettered by the
capricious output of gold, then its freedom of expansion
is fettered. If the output of legal tender
currency cannot keep pace with the needs and
requirements of commerce, then the limitations
imposed are not in accord with true notions of
freedom. We must work and progress as best we
can within those limitations, whether they be wise or
unwise.</p>

<p>Since the war the Government appears to me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
have recognized this by the issue of Treasury notes.
Had these notes not been issued, then it would have
been the duty of the Government to have suspended
the Bank Act. Having issued these notes, the
Government could conscientiously ask the banks to
assist in a time of crisis traders and others with the
utmost liberality. If they were not so assisted,
the bankers justly deserved admonition. But had
the Government not have issued the notes and therewith
have provided legal tender currency in ample
measure, then it could not, conscientiously and justly,
have bidden the banks to lend freely irrespective of
their gold reserves. If, however, these reserves were
to be replenished, then the banks were sufficiently
safeguarded. There was no excuse for ultra-caution
and timidity then.</p>

<p>I repeat, therefore, that what the Government
has done once by way of duty and by way of wisdom
and foresight, it can do again, and should do. The
country must not come to ruin merely in deference
to the apprehensive theories of some people, whose
theories so far, though long and tenaciously held,
have been like the passing nightmares of affrighted
men.</p>

<p>In the days when Mr. Bagehot wrote his immortal
work, banking was still in the experimental stage.
It was slowly developing and learning from experience.
As banking has developed, so has the psychology
of the British race changed. As the confines of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
its knowledge have been enlarged, as each generation
has arrived in a new environment, and as each
generation has become more familiar with and
habituated to banking, so are the probabilities of
panic lessened. A panic, after all, has a psychological
origin, and if, as I contend, the psychology
of our race is on a higher plane, and is more dependable
than it was half a century ago, then Mr.
Bagehot’s criticisms become less forcible as psychological
growth proceeds. They must not be taken,
therefore, as our criterion to-day, because the test
applied to them now is a different test. As the years
go on the criticisms will become feebler, and with his
profound instinctive knowledge of human nature, I
think, were he alive to-day, Mr. Bagehot would
modify those criticisms that deserved more consideration
in his days than in ours. He would be the first
to acknowledge, not only that the banking system
has progressed greatly, but that the system is conducted
on safer lines than in the times when he lived.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> has been said, and said truly, that the law can
exercise much restraint upon the freedom of the
individual. It is powerless, however, to restrain
madness. Yet it is precisely by artificial methods
that we would attempt to restrain madness, to keep
individuals and nations in a state of sanity. This
cannot be done. If the problem we are dealing with
is psychological, we must find a psychological solution.
We cannot cure a spiritual disease by a
material remedy. If we can grasp the potency of
fear growing into that species of madness called
panic, we shall be able to grasp the tremendous task
of allaying that fear during its earliest symptoms. We
should also grasp the immensity of the task when we
conceive how the healers of the disease would themselves
be afflicted by the disease, and that their
fears would confuse their minds and paralyse their
actions.</p>

<p>Long before the greatest war in history broke out,
we were assured by financial and economic prophets
that when it did break out this country would be in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
the throes of the most serious panic it has ever
known, and thousands of our business men would go
down to ruin in it. These prophecies were based
upon the inadequacy of our gold reserves, and upon
the top-heaviness of our credit superstructure.</p>

<p>These prophecies have not been fulfilled. We
have had no panic, not even when the Bank of England
reserve fell to the lowest point for many a year,
not even when the rate rose swiftly to ten per cent.
Thousands of our great business men have not been
ruined. These are facts, not theories. They are
realizations, not predictions. So far from there
having been a panic, it has been very difficult at
times, as all acute observers will testify, to realize
that this country was at last engaged in a life and
death struggle. It was prophesied, too, and with no
doubts or hesitation, that the numbers of men thrown
out of employment would be so great, that drastic
martial law would have to be resorted to. These predictions
also have not been justified. The percentage
of employment has steadily risen, and this nation
has pursued its affairs and avocations calmly under
normal police law.</p>

<p>If we are to learn deep and lasting lessons from
experience, this experience is of vastly greater value
than theory. In Germany and in France also we see
vast accumulations of gold, in comparison with which
our own gold reserves are puny. Yet we not only
raised immense war loans at a high price, but have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
helped other countries with loans, while our burdens
were increased with the heavier taxes imposed upon us.</p>

<p>True it is that but for our navy, circumstances
might have been greatly different. But had our navy
been sunk, had Germany acquired undisputed mastery
of the sea, had she been able to starve us, then no
gold reserves, even though mountains high, would
have saved us. The country could not live on gold
alone. It would have perished, and its banking
system with it. We cannot wage a life and death
struggle with gold alone, nor with credit alone.</p>

<p>But when the former prophecies were made, no
account was made of the navy. The panic was to
come independently of the navy’s power. The public,
the moment war was declared, would realize that the
gold reserves were inadequate, they would clamour for
gold, the banks would close, and in a day or two the
money market would be a deserted, silent place,
stricken and devastated like some of the cities of
Belgium.</p>

<p>Why did not this come to pass? Why were the
prophets not trusty seers? It is said that the bankers
met in conference to consider and exchange opinions
upon the position. They knew well enough that they
were no magicians, nor even ordinary conjurors.
They knew they could not make gold out of nothing.
What, then, could they do? Whether or not their
consciences smote them I know not. Whether or not
they bitterly repented and lamented the poverty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
their gold reserves I know not. Whether or not they
said to each other, in a hopeless, perplexed way: “I
told you so,” I know not. All I do know is that a
saviour came, a <i lang="la">deux ex machina</i>, that he was received
with open arms, welcomed with fervid gratitude, perhaps
with tears, that he was venerated, and that some
to-day, in their profound gratitude, would make him
a duke.</p>

<p>Well, this saviour came and calmed that assembly;
in a magical way, subdued all fear, removed all perplexities,
daring to do, so some say, what some bankers
themselves dared not even hint. Greatness of mind
saved them and the nation and not the greatness of
our gold reserves, and this greatness of mind has
been acknowledged by all, not with the reluctance
of envy, but in the spirit of sincere thankfulness.
Greatness of mind, then, saved the nation from the
consequences of that psychological evil, fear and
madness. It was the right mental solution to a
mental disease. The spirit saved the spirit.</p>

<p>So it has been throughout the ages. Greatness
of mind has led nations on. Littleness of mind has
brought them down. And who will deny that it is
littleness of mind that has brought Germany down?
A nation derives its greatness from the greatness of
its greatest souls.</p>

<p>The nation was saved, then, in the hour of destiny
by obedience to wisdom. We cannot imagine in the
future a vaster crisis than the nation—yea, the world—faced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
in that dark hour in August. It was not alone
the magnitude of it, it was the suddenness of it. We
were unprepared for it, and if wisdom could save us
in this hour, what can we hope from wisdom in the
hour of less peril?</p>

<p>Had wisdom not prevailed, had we abandoned
ourselves to divided counsels and to folly, we might
not have saved ourselves from the consequences had
our gold reserves been much higher. They might
quickly have disappeared. Theoretic lines of safety
would not then have averted the wreck. They would
not, with magic power, have kept the public back.</p>

<p>In that hour some would have cried hysterically:
“Lend, lend, lend!” Others, “Save, save, save!”
and only confusion and perplexity would come of it.
But the public were told, by the representative of the
Government, by the authoritative voice of the nation
itself: “Be calm! All your wants will be supplied!
The Government will supply them.”</p>

<p>When a hungry multitude is clamouring for food,
mad with hunger, and when the barns are filled, they
are not appeased if told there is only sufficient food
for a few. Tell them there is enough food to go
round, even though it must be given sparingly, then
the clamour dies down and the multitude becomes
calm and patient.</p>

<p>We saw no multitude clamouring for gold. The
clamour was merely anticipated. There may have
been no clamour, but it was wise to anticipate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
prepare for its possibility. At the right moment,
therefore, the public were assured that money, not
gold, would be forthcoming in any amount. It was
money, not gold, that allayed the first symptoms of
fear. With this money, no matter though it were
paper, the public were content. The notes were
instruments of law that placed them in an impregnable
position, and in an impregnable position they
knew they were safe.</p>

<p>The faith the public put in gold is probably
greatly magnified. The public are not deeply versed
enough in monetary and currency problems to understand
the importance of gold as distinct from other
money, especially legal tender paper. The ordinary
man in possession of twenty £5 notes feels that he is
equally as safe and as strong as the man in possession
of one hundred sovereigns. We must not ignore
this fact, nor minimize it, when we argue about high
and low gold reserves. He knows that with notes he
can be just as solvent as the man with gold, though
he may think the notes a greater nuisance than gold.
And this belief and trust of his, this calmness, are all
essential elements of the psychological problem that
confronts the currency theorist and the banker.
They are not to be considered as mental phenomena
independent of that problem. They go to make up
its complexity.</p>

<p>London being a free market for gold it was feared
in a crisis such as we have experienced, that the gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
would quickly be withdrawn from the Bank of England
and shipped abroad, and that in a short time we
should find ourselves with no gold reserves. This did
not happen. Granted that a great deal of gold was
withdrawn from the Bank, this was only temporary,
and since those days the Bank has secured gold at
a pace no prophet ever calculated. Two predictions
here have also been falsified. Neither the gold withdrawals,
nor the gold arrivals and accumulations
were on a scale forecasted by the theorist. Their
pre-calculations went ludicrously astray.</p>

<span class="subhead">EQUITABLE RESPONSIBILITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">If</span> gold reserves alone are to be the test of sound
banking, and if gold reserves alone are to save banks
in the hour of crisis or panic, then the obligations of
banks towards the highest interests of the community
are weakened. If their wealth, their investments are
to be valueless in a time of crisis, to be so ignored,
that is, as to be worthless, to be taken no account of,
are not to keep them solvent and safe, then on what
grounds of reason and justice should the community
demand that banks should confine their trading to
the highest class of wealth? On what grounds can
the community demand that they should in all
seasons and in all times do that great work for trade
and commerce which neither the Government nor
any other institution does? Why should the banks
be asked to do all the sacrificing within the limitations
imposed by the community and the community
not come to their help, sacrifice nothing at
all, in the hour of the community’s troubles? For
the crisis, when it comes, is the nation’s and not
solely the banks’ crisis. If the crisis be none of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
nation’s seeking, it will certainly be none of the
banks’ seeking. If, however, the crisis be the effect
of over-speculation on the part of the community, it
would be mean action on the part of the community
to appeal to the banks to save it from the consequences
of its own folly.</p>

<p>I urge that, in a time of national crisis, which has
taken the nation by surprise, which is no consequence
of its own folly, the responsibility should be shared
by the nation and the banks. It is possible that
it was this high sense of justice, this high sense of
equity, that inspired the measures that were taken
last August, and that brought the country safely
through the crisis. Had it not been for this higher
inspiration and deeper vision, and had we trusted
alone to narrow instinct and lack of insight, confusion
might have reigned, and the consequences might have
been as serious as those foretold by the prophets.</p>

<p>If we are to lay it down as a rigid, unwritten law,
a law existing only in the conscience of an irresponsible
community, that banks must save themselves
only by their gold reserves, then by what
divine or earthly sense of justice shall we demand
that banks shall not speculate? Are the banks to
be the keepers of our consciences, as well as of our
purses? The banks must live. And if instead of
building up their deposits on sound wealth, they
build them up on unsound wealth, and keep that
proportion of reserves which critics demand they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
shall keep, then they will have fulfilled their duty
from the standpoint of this narrow conception.
Suppose they speculated and kept even higher reserves
than those laid down by the mathematicians,
content with the higher profits made from speculation,
by whose standards of equity are they to be
judged?</p>

<p>If high gold reserves alone can save them, or
should save them, and they possess these high
reserves, then they can be saved even if they speculated.
If the oracles say so, it must be so. If sound
wealth be useless to them, then unsound wealth
could not be more useless. If they could not get
legal tender for sound wealth, for gilt-edged securities,
they would be no worse off with brass-edged
securities.</p>

<p>As I have already insisted, it is something
beyond lack of reason to ask banks in the same
moment to lend freely and to save their gold
reserves. It is as unreasonable as asking an ordinary
man to be generous and prodigal and at the same
time close-fisted and thrifty.</p>

<p>Take that measure of the Government whereby
it arranged with the Bank of England to discount,
without recourse to the holder, all approved bills
accepted before the declaration of the moratorium,
guaranteeing the Bank against any loss it might
incur. This was, of course, placing a burden on the
shoulders of the community which was a perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
equitable burden. But quite apart from its equity,
it was, in its lowest aspect, an expedient burden.
That is to say, if the nation had refused to shoulder
this burden, it would have had a far greater burden
to bear in the dislocation of trade and its incalculable
losses.</p>

<p>It would not have been just to place this burden
entirely on the shoulders of the banks. In such a
crisis the entire community had to face the perils as
a whole, and sink or swim as a whole.</p>

<p>When in the end the gains and losses are weighed,
perhaps we shall find that the gains, moral and
material, greatly outweigh the losses.</p>

<p>What was the duty of the banks, when this
measure was proclaimed, towards the nation and
towards themselves? Looking at it from the low
standpoint of self-preservation, what was their duty?
From a low and a high standpoint alike it was their
duty to help the Government, help the nation,
through the Bank of England. They could not give
that effective help by hoarding their gold, by getting
it from the Bank of England, by sending borrowers
to the Bank of England, by refusing help to legitimate
needs. Yet this is what some critics counselled
them to do—counselled them to increase and not ease
the difficulties of the Bank of England.</p>

<p>If the country could depend calmly and securely
on the Bank of England, with the Government
behind it, then the banks also could depend upon it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
The Bank of England was the bulwark of England.
That bulwark could be weakened and not strengthened
by the hoarding of gold. If the Press and others
admonished, and wisely admonished, the citizens not
to hoard gold, then it was illogical to ask the banks
to hoard it, for they would be hoarding the citizens’
gold. These contrary counsels were opposed to all
reason, and yet to this hour I see them advocated in
some quarters in the Press.</p>

<p>The Bank of England needed all the gold it could
get as a basis for the discounting of this huge mass
of pre-moratorium paper. Gold subsequently poured
in from the gold mines and elsewhere, yet notwithstanding
this mighty inflow, the proportion of the
Bank’s reserve to the ever-growing deposits kept
comparatively low, far below the normal proportion.
It was in the interests of the country that the Bank
should get this gold from any quarters to enable it to
make a success of the remedial measure and to ease
the country’s financial burdens. How, then, could it
at the same time be in the interests of the nation for
the joint stock banks to take gold from the Bank, to
hoard it and not to send it there?</p>

<p>Such action as this would have been inconsistent
with the fervent gratitude the bank chairmen and
the country have felt towards the Government and
its advisers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, what made it additionally ill-advised
on the part of the banks to hoard gold and pile up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
their reserves, was the subsequent proclamation by
the Government to the effect that the Bank of
England, on the authority of the Government, would
advance the necessary funds to meet acceptances for
which cover was not duly forthcoming from clients,
until one year after the close of the war. This
removed all necessity to hoard gold and to pile up
reserves, and it justified the rebuke of the Chancellor
of the Exchequer to those banks that refused necessary
accommodation to legitimate business. It was
also a rebuke to those critics who have seen no refuge
for the country in the dark hour of trouble except in
hoarding by the banks and parting by the public.
That is to say, they counsel the public not to demand
gold, and they counsel the banks to keep it. If,
therefore, the public are not to demand gold, and if
the banks are to accumulate it in their vaults, then
it means that in a crisis we can do without gold, and
that, after all, the credit which the banks are said to
create will alone save us. They are told that if they
will only go on creating this credit they will enable
us to pass safely through the crisis. It comes to this,
that the advice given places us in mental confusion.
Actual experience, therefore, seems to be trustier
than illogical advice.</p>

<p>What has been the direct consequence of this discounting
of pre-moratorium bills and this great inflow
of gold, despite the issue of a War Loan to the
prodigious amount of £350,000,000? In the words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
of the money article, day by day and week by week,
money has been a glut on the market, and has been
lent on nominal terms, while discount rates have
also fallen to nominal quotations. In other words,
the great joint stock banks, in spite of themselves,
have seen their gold reserves rising to an unprecedented
extent. Of what benefit to the country is
this great mass of idle gold? It is unproductive.
It serves no useful purpose if it cannot be employed.
It is like the grain in the barns perishing because it
cannot be consumed. Yet in spite of this state of
things, due to the supply of liquid capital exceeding
the output of wealth, there have been those who
have lamented the fall in discount rates lest this
should turn the exchanges against us, and gold
should be taken to New York or elsewhere. Would
it not be beneficial if some of the gold did go? If it
went in payment of wealth received, the gold would
then become productive. The right service of gold
is to help to produce wealth, and if it does this it
performs the services deputed to it by the community.
When gold passes from one nation to another in
exchange for wealth it never passes permanently. I
might just as reasonably urge that when I pay gold
to my tailor for my dress suit I part with the gold
for ever. I should part with it only in the event of
my immediate decease, or if I became a non-producer,
or in other ways were deprived of all claims
on the general wealth of the community. An idle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
man, with pockets filled with gold, is a burden on
the community. He is no helper, no benefactor.
So a nation, idle, with mighty safes filled with gold,
will become stagnant if this gold is not scattered
broadcast in the shape of capital that energizes
the productive and consumptive capacity of man and
the land.</p>

<p>The value of gold will ever inhere in its wise use,
not in its non-use.</p>

<p>“It has been well said,” remarked Sir Felix
Schuster, in his recent annual address, “that it is
one of the paradoxes of finance, that at the moment
when the world’s capital is being squandered in war
the value of loanable capital in Lombard Street has
actually depreciated.” Sir Felix meant, of course,
that there was no great demand for capital, that it
was greatly in excess of needs, that loans consequently
were cheap, and that banks could hardly
lend profitably. I see no paradox in this. If the
creation of bank money is to be regulated by the
supply of gold only, it is an orthodox consequence.
Since the outbreak of the war the inflow of gold has
been greater than ever experienced. This has given
the banks power to lend more, to liquefy more
wealth, because their reserves have increased, and
the proportion of these to the liabilities has correspondingly
risen. But though a great deal of wealth
has come into existence, it must not be overlooked
that a great portion of it is not the kind of wealth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
banks lend on. This was partly due to the closing
of the Stock Exchange, the subsequent restrictions
on business there, and the destruction of trade
between the belligerent and other countries. Securities
of a high class were scarce, and bills of exchange
became scarce, and while many industries, notably
the cotton industry, severely suffered, other industries,
especially war-provisioning industries, became
abnormally busy. There was deadlock for months in
some of the foreign exchanges, especially the New
York and Russian exchanges. While the kind of
wealth on which banks lend fell off, the mines continued
to produce gold, thus showing again how
independent this output is of real wealth production.
Had the gold mines also ceased working at the
beginning of the war, have suspended operations for
many months, we should not have seen, perhaps,
loanable capital in Lombard Street so excessive and
so depreciated as it was.</p>

<p>Sir Felix saw a great danger in this great mass
of money and its cheapness: the danger of its turning
the exchanges against us. But this danger could
have done no more harm than the stoppage of the
gold mines had the rebellion spread in South Africa.
The danger can be easily exaggerated, especially at a
moment when we can see far ahead, and see the gold
still coming to us in an uninterrupted stream from
the mines.</p>

<p>Even had the New York exchange turned against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
us, it would turn round again in due course, as it
always has done and always will do so long as international
commerce proceeds.</p>

<p>By no jugglery can we, in the existing system,
make cheap money dear, any more than we can
make cheap apples dear. It can be done by cornering;
but no cornering of money is possible. If banks
cannot lend at 1 per cent., they certainly cannot lend
at 2 per cent. Human nature must be re-created
first. If men will not part with bills of discount
at 1½ per cent., they will not part with them at 1¾
per cent., and there is no law, written or unwritten,
that will compel them to do this. The law of supply
and demand operates as irresistibly in this case as
when we buy apples at an old lady’s stall.</p>

<p>If there be great danger in a great abundance
and cheapness of money, then there must be a great
danger in an abundance of gold, which is the source
of the cheap money. Logic teaches us this. Reduce
the gold, hoard it or throw it in the ocean, then the
supply of Lombard Street money will decrease and
loanable rates will rise.</p>

<span class="subhead">CORRELATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> may now pertinently be asked: Is it possible to
keep high gold reserves in the joint stock banks,
taking them as a unit, and simultaneously a high
reserve in the Bank of England? By high reserves
I mean, of course, a high proportion, for this is what
we all mean. What is the test of a high reserve?
There is no other test than the ratio of the gold
reserve to the liabilities. We cannot test it by a
quantity of gold <i lang="la">per se</i>. We cannot say that a hypothetical
quantity is sufficient and a hypothetical
quantity insufficient. A reserve must be related to
something. When we speak of gold reserves we
speak correlatively. They are not something standing
apart, in the air, as it were, an independent
quantity.</p>

<p>If, then, when we speak of gold reserves, we are
conscious of their relation to something, what is this
something? Is it their relation to the nation’s commerce
as a whole, the nation’s needs as a whole, or
merely the restricted relationship to bank liabilities?
What critics mean is the relation between them and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the bank liabilities. But banks are units of a
system. They are not a whole in the same sense
as the Bank of England is. They are independent
entities. There are large banks and small banks
and medium-sized banks, and they have liabilities
corresponding to their size. Must the small bank
have in its safes exactly the same <em>quantity</em> of gold as
the large bank, irrespective of its liabilities? Or
must the small bank have, not the same quantity,
but the same <em>proportion</em>? Or are we to aggregate
all the liabilities of the banks of the kingdom and all
their gold reserves and say whether or not the total
quantity of gold is sufficient or insufficient? Even
then we must ask: Sufficient for what? Sufficient
to meet the total liabilities in a time of crisis? This
is what we mean. We mean a ratio, a hypothetical
ratio that is to save us from disaster.</p>

<p>Now this ratio is constantly fluctuating. It is
fluctuating hour by hour, day by day, week by week,
month by month, and year by year. It is impossible
to keep it rigid. The critics know this, and they say
that only an approximate ratio is wanted. But as
we can never foretell, never pre-calculate what an
approximate crisis will be, an approximate panic, or
an approximate run, an approximate ratio may not
save us. If mathematics alone will save us, and not
common sense, then we must have mathematical precision,
seeing that we are dealing with figures, not
brains and temperaments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>The only way to keep up an approximate ratio is,
not to buy gold, as many advocate, and hoard it, but
to stop lending, to call in loans, and so raise the
ratio figure. Then we can have a relative high gold
reserve. We are speaking, of course, in an ideal
sense, for there can be no simultaneous precision in
these movements amongst a number of independent
banks, whose business varies hour by hour.</p>

<p>However, in order to maintain their high ratio
banks must cease to lend when this ratio threatens
to fall. It is useless buying several millions worth
of gold—if it could be bought—only to lend more
upon it, increase the liabilities and not alter the
habitual proportion.</p>

<p>If, therefore, banks cease to lend in order to keep
up a high ratio of reserves to liabilities, what will be
the inevitable effect of this upon the reserve of the
Bank of England? They will drive borrowers, as has
been explained in former chapters, to the Bank. As
the Bank begins to lend, so will the ratio of its reserve
to its liabilities drop. Mr. Cole says the Bank of England
will always lend <em>at a price</em>. If, then, the Bank’s
ratio drops, then the ratio of the reserves of the
joint stock banks must fall, seeing that they hold
their reserves at the Bank of England. The ratio
will then drop in proportion to the aggregate bank
liabilities of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The only remedy, then, is for the Bank of England
also to refuse to lend. But Mr. Bagehot and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
other critics say this would bring on and aggravate
a crisis. So far from refusing to lend, banks, they
say, must lend liberally, with both hands. How,
then, are the Bank of England and the other banks
to lend liberally without increasing their liabilities
and reducing the proportion? The proportion could
be maintained only by an inflow of gold proportionate
to the rise in the liabilities. How are we to start
this inflow at the critical moment and maintain it?</p>

<p>It cannot be done. There can, however, be an
automatic inflow, but only of legal tender notes, and
legal tender, from the standpoint of bank solvency, is
as potent as gold. We cannot produce gold at will,
but we can produce paper at will.</p>

<p>Our gold reserves should be controlled, as I have
insisted already, not solely by the arbitrary output of
gold, but by the output of the nation’s wealth, and
by the nation’s needs, and no artificial obstacles
should arrest the growth of national wealth. We do
put obstacles in the way. Banks must keep an eye
on their approximate reserves. This is why they
refuse to lend at times, and send wealth-producers to
the Bank of England. We have to put up with this
in our present system. But to say that some hypothetical
ratio, which no one can agree upon, will save
us in certain grave, incalculable contingencies is as
untenable as many another economic hypothesis
which has no relation to the complexity of human
character and temperament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<p>But the theorists have insisted in years past, it is
not the national needs we have to consider in a time
of crisis; it is the international claims upon us.
Look, they say, at the enormous foreign credits here,
placing unlimited power in the hands of foreigners
to take gold from us <em>in the time of war</em>. Well, the
war has come, the greatest of all wars, the war we
and the world most dreaded, and all these pre-existing
fears have not been realized. Foreign credits
are offset by foreign liabilities here. Instead of gold
being taken abroad in great quantity the exact
opposite has occurred, and why should it never
recur? Gold has come to London in quantities
never dreamed of and never experienced, proving
that the dimensions of this hypothetical danger were
greatly magnified.</p>

<p>Since the war we have had too much gold and too
much capital, even at a time when unemployment
was low. I mean too much bank capital.</p>

<p>It follows that, as conditions of banking are at
present, we cannot have high proportionate gold
reserves in the joint stock banks simultaneously
with a high proportionate reserve in the Bank of
England. This can only be done by stopping the
wheels of commerce, or slowing them down by
advances of the Bank of England rate to attract
gold from abroad. But the gold must flow in as
rapidly as the liabilities rise, unless the Bank of
England stops lending too. Trade must be penalized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
whichever action be taken, and merchants and others
would rather have low ratios than be penalized.
They would suffer, and the country would share their
sufferings. To refuse to lend would have serious
consequences and would be the surest way to hasten
a panic.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SUPPLEMENTARY INFLOW</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">If</span> there must be in the country, for the benefit of
the country’s trade and commerce, for ensuring its
prosperity, a loanable fund, why should no provision
be made for what I call the supplementary inflow?
If no provision of this kind is made by a nation, how
can we reconcile this with national foresight? In
carrying on business on the soundest principles of
finance business concerns allow amply for contingencies
by building up reserve funds. If this be
sound in individual business, it should be sound in
national business. We cannot logically have contrary
business principles for the nation and the individual,
for in that direction confusion lies.</p>

<p>The nation trades on its capital. It is a vast
undertaking, with a colossal capital. It incurs huge
liabilities, but against them it has huge assets. Why
should it not have amongst these assets large hidden
reserves?</p>

<p>Some wealth depreciates, while other wealth
appreciates. Some wealth is destroyed, while new
wealth is created. Wealth is not destroyed by war<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
alone. It is destroyed by new desires, new inventions—which
destroy the wealth brought into existence
by former inventions and bring ruin on some industries
and men,—new fashions, and by lack of hope
and diminishing confidence. On the Stock Exchange
in recent years we have seen continual depreciation.
But other assets may at the same time have greatly
appreciated.</p>

<p>We cannot get more gold than nature will produce,
and every ounce taken from her store lessens that
store. And the store will diminish as the future
needs of the world grow.</p>

<p>The gathering of the gold and the garnering of it,
like the garnering of seed we fear to sow, must be
done at the expense of our wealth production. The
harvest of wealth must be less because of the
scantier seed sowing; in other words, because of
the diminished capital employed. Instead, therefore,
of the gold coming out of the nation’s profits, it
would come out of the nation’s capital, for unused
capital is not used capital.</p>

<p>Gold is our capital in a fundamental sense. If
all the gold in the world were suddenly destroyed,
banks would cease to exist. Whence, then, could we
get the means of multiplying our capital? The
productive machinery of the country would become
inert. International trading would cease, because
international exchange would cease. Bills of exchange
would be as worthless as old newspapers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
for they would be unnegotiable. We should have
to get a substitute for gold.</p>

<p>We try to attract gold to this country because it
is gold that keeps the capital-multiplying machinery
going, as oil keeps other machinery going. If we
always had a sufficiency of it there would be no
occasion for high Bank of England rates. If there
be just a sufficiency and no more, then we cannot
spare any for hoarding purposes.</p>

<p>It would be wise of the nation to have at its
command a potential supplementary supply, not of
gold, but of legal tender, for legal tender can perform
all the offices of gold as national currency. Gold is
given its potency because it is made legal tender.
It has no other vital potency. Therefore paper, or
any other substance, can be given equal potency
by law.</p>

<p>Now, the necessity of having this supplementary
supply has been tacitly acknowledged. The acknowledgment
is implied in the provisions of the Bank
Charter Act and the provision of legal tender notes
based on debt and securities. This provision, as I
have pointed out already, is arbitrary. It was fixed
at a time when no man had the visionary power to
foresee and forecast the great development of banking
in this country and the vast development of its
national and international trade. It was fixed at a
time when the country was groping towards a greatly
improved currency system, a system that has helped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
in an incalculable degree the growth and development
of our commerce.</p>

<p>But in the recent crisis it was not this potential
supply that the nation actually tapped. Before it
could be tapped it was necessary to suspend the Bank
Charter Act. Instead of this happening, a new and
unlooked-for supply was forthcoming in the shape of
the Treasury notes.</p>

<p>This issue of Treasury notes brought a new
fiduciary currency into existence, and the issue was
on all fours with a free Government loan—a loan,
that is to say, on which no interest was paid. It
provided not only currency for the country, but
“silver war-bullets” for the Government. The issue
performed all the essential services which the supplementary
fund I advocate should and would perform.</p>

<p>I am convinced that the alarm felt throughout the
country in those first critical days was magnified.
There was certainly some apprehension; but no good
purpose would be served by magnifying it. It is
indisputable, too, that even this moderate apprehension
disappeared the moment it was known that
a large amount of legal tender would be issued in the
shape of £1 and 10<i>s.</i> Treasury notes.</p>

<p>The notes were based on what we call the credit,
or wealth, of the country. The public placed their
confidence in them because they felt they were placing
confidence in the wealth and power of the country,
in themselves as a nation. They could have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
sounder basis. The nation was indifferent to the
convertibility or inconvertibility of the notes. All
the country was conscious of was that the notes were
legal tender and as good as gold.</p>

<p>Theorists attach too much importance to the effect
upon the public mind of an issue of inconvertible
notes. The great mass of people does not understand
convertibility or inconvertibility, certainly not in the
deep sense critics imagine it does. It understands,
however, confidence in the Government, and this
confidence is of greater worth than are vague ideas
of convertibility. The mass of the public is ignorant
of monetary and currency problems, but it is not
ignorant of the power of the Government and the
power of the law. When the mass of the public had
these notes—and even postal orders as legal tender—in
its possession, it knew it had purchasing power
equal to the denomination of the notes, and that
was all-sufficient. This explains the public’s satisfaction
and calmness. Moreover, it is a phenomenon
of deep psychological importance.</p>

<p>There were sections of the public—merchants,
financiers, bankers, academicians, theorists, and pressmen—who
knew that the notes, though issued as convertible,
had behind them no gold backing. But even
many of these were not erudite students of currency.
Nevertheless, they could not help feeling and acknowledging
that the right and wise thing had been done.
And as for merchants, bill-brokers, bankers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
other people who wanted legal tender currency, they
cared not so long as they could get it. This was their
chief concern. It was a matter of indifference to them
whether the notes were convertible or inconvertible.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most fruitful point for controversy
at this juncture, now that we have experienced the
benefits of the policy, is whether it would have been
better to have suspended the Bank Act and have
issued Bank of England notes, or to have done what
actually was done. Much can be urged in support
of each policy. Bank of England notes would have
obviated any confusion arising from two distinct
species of fiduciary paper currency.</p>

<p>The great virtue and convenience of the new
notes was their low denomination. It would have
created needless difficulties, perhaps, to have given
power to the Bank of England to issue such notes.
Confusion, therefore, was greatly lessened by making
the Treasury notes of low denomination and by
keeping the Bank of England notes at a high
denomination. As a fiduciary note, currency should
be as simple as possible and not complicated, the
distinction between the denominations should conform
to the idea of simplicity.</p>

<p>I think it would be wise to teach the people that
the currency of the country is in reality based upon
the wealth of the country, and not upon an extraneous
thing like the capricious production of gold. This
would assist it to grasp more easily currency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
problems. What would be the state of this country
with a mountain of gold and no wealth? Currency
being issued on a basis of wealth, it is issued on
something solid and durable.</p>

<p>A certain London evening newspaper wrote in this
wise several months after the outbreak of the war:
“The puzzled public which draw its cheques and
accepts the cheques of others with a firm and
pathetic belief in the value of ‘a scrap of paper,’ was
a little scared at first when the value of securities
tumbled down and it had to accept notes in place of
its accustomed solid coin. People began to ask
whether the alleged wealth of the country was
supported by anything solid at all, or whether we
had not been living on a fiction. Fortunately, time
has proved that it is very substantial indeed.”</p>

<p>Quite so. The wealth of this country is the most
substantial possession the country has. But, all the
same, there are many fallacies in the above passage.
The public were not puzzled, and there is no pathos
in its belief in the value of cheques. It was not
scared, even for a moment, when it had to accept
notes, no more scared than it has been when it has
received Bank of England notes. It took them with
inquisitiveness, but also readily and gladly. People
did not ask if the wealth of the country was
“alleged” and whether it was a fiction, and I think
it is foolish to put ideas into the heads of the public
which originally were never there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>Is it absolutely necessary to issue a <em>limited</em> amount
of Treasury or other legal tender notes based on
gold? Or may the amount be unlimited? In a
war of world-wide magnitude, the Government and
the nation had to take account of the vital fact that,
not only might our commerce be destroyed by the
enemy’s navy, but that it might be impossible to
bring gold over to this country. This had to be foreseen
and provided for. The joint stock banks, however
high their gold reserves, could not alter this.
Therefore it was necessary, apart from these
reserves, to meet immediate emergencies by the issue
of legal tender notes. Though afterwards the Bank
of England was credited with enormous amounts of
gold, this gold did not come to London. It was
placed to the Bank’s account, or credit, in South
Africa, Australia, and Ottawa. This restricted probably
the supply of gold coin at a time when there
was an unprecedented demand for small currency for
our military requirements and in our vast military
camps. Though some industries may have slowed
down greatly, others worked at high pressure,
thereby probably more than offsetting the inactivity
of others. And allowance must be made for the
thousands called to the colours who might otherwise
have been parasites. By joining the army their
aggregate consumptive powers increased. All these
developments had to be pre-calculated, apart from
the positions of the joint stock banks and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
preparations for panic. It was not the time to hoard
gold, but to see that legal tender currency was
provided in ample measure.</p>

<p>Ample measure is not superabundance, and if the
needs were just met nothing further was necessary.
Assuming, therefore, that they were just met and
no more, we may ask whether or not it would be wise
to withdraw the notes when the war is over and
normal conditions are restored. It is, perhaps, too
early to reply in dogmatic fashion.</p>

<p>We must take into consideration that we may
never again see a world-war and never again face a
crisis such as we faced in August last. But I see no
powerful objection to the notes remaining. We may
regard them as the nucleus of the nation’s reserve
fund, the liquefying of its hidden credit, or wealth
reserve, as the veritable “I believe” in the immeasurable
potential wealth of the country. The War Loan
is another such reserve, a reserve representing the
present and future credit, or wealth, of the country.
The country’s potential wealth is the security behind
it. And the Treasury note issue may be regarded as
part of the loan, for the gold “ear-marked” against
it has probably come out of that loan. If the notes
were redeemed and the gold released again, the gold
would go into circulation and form part of the banks’
reserves as before. By retaining the gold the
Government would have that store of gold which
critics have been asking for. So far as they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
concerned, therefore, their wishes would be fulfilled.
They could gaze with satisfaction on this store of
gold, for the delicate problem has been solved as to
who should buy it and store it and bear the expense
of it.</p>

<p>Evidently it is the intention to have a gold
reserve equal to 100 per cent. of the notes in issue.
I see no urgency in this, no vital necessity. The
notes could be based partly on gold and partly on
Consols. I think a reserve equal to 50 or 60 per
cent. in gold would be ample.</p>

<p>If posterity is to benefit more from the war than
the present generation, why should it not bear a
goodly part of the burden?</p>

<p>It may be objected that Consols are a depreciating
security. They are an appreciating security also,
and years hence they may have a much higher value
than they have now. Gold also appreciates and
depreciates continually, measured by the prices of
securities and commodities. And the entire wealth
of the country is constantly appreciating and
depreciating.</p>

<p>If the credit of the nation years after the war
becomes much higher than it is now, then to secure
the notes on the credit of the nation is to secure them
on something that will rise in value.</p>

<p>This issue would not be like the varieties of paper
issues in Germany, whose credit has depreciated and
will continue to depreciate as her wealth diminishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
and becomes less negotiable. She cannot, as we can,
pay for goods entirely with goods, owing to the
destruction of her commerce. She must pay in gold;
in other words, she must live on her capital. And
she cannot live on her capital and speedily renew it.
There must be considerable destruction, because it
cannot quickly reproduce itself.</p>

<p>I would, therefore, base part of the new issue on
a sound security like Consols, which is representative
of the country’s credit, or wealth. The notes themselves
are representative of its wealth, therefore
Consols would be an extra security. I would not
advocate the withdrawal of the notes, because the
machinery has now been provided for possible use at
a future crisis. The machinery could be set in
motion again without resorting to the cumbersome
process of suspending the Bank Charter Act. It
gives us a provision for unknown contingencies.</p>

<p>To keep a limited amount of Treasury notes in
existence should be no more a potential danger to the
future of our financial fabric than the issue of a huge
war loan. On the contrary, they should help us the
better to bear the burden of a war loan if there be no
improvident, or over-issue of them. They should be
no greater menace than the sudden, prodigious output
of gold which we could not use. We would not
declaim against the imports of huge quantities of gold
each week and the corresponding increase of currency.
If so arbitrary an increase could do no harm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
would be considered beneficial, then a limited supply
of other currency, such as our Treasury notes, should
not be harmful. And if the discounting of millions of
unnegotiable pre-moratorium acceptances, creating
currency in such abundance as to make it exceedingly
cheap, is not harmful, then the issue of a limited
quantity of Treasury notes, against which the Government
is setting aside an equal quantity of gold,
should not be harmful. To predict that it will bring
economic evil in a distant future that cannot be foreseen,
is as valuable as many another theory that has
failed to stand the test of reality.</p>

<p>It should be no more harmful to the future than
the issue of Bank of England notes has been, based
on a book debt and securities, during the last seventy
years.</p>

<span class="subhead">CREDIT AND CIVILIZATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">I have</span> endeavoured to argue that our banking system
and a purely credit system are not identical. A perfect
credit system would be based entirely on faith, or
profound belief in individual and national integrity
and honour. Tradesmen know what kind of credit
this is. They know that men may have huge and
safe balances in banks, yet may be rogues. But a
bank’s faith is not of this implicit and profound
character. A bank demands material evidence of
faith, and it places greater value and trust in the
matter than in the spirit. Our banking system is
ahead of the banking systems of other countries, but
this is largely because our economic organism is
older, our national character stronger, our freedom
greater. Our so-called bank credit rests primarily on
national wealth and secondarily on character. A
bank will not lend on character alone. Character is
not the wealth it is ready to transform.</p>

<p>It will not lend to the poor man, however noble
in character. But it will lend to the rogue who has
sound security and other solid wealth. If it can have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
no faith in the rogue’s character, it has faith in his
wealth, and it takes care to have his wealth first.
Banks, therefore, are not judges of morals. A man’s
private morals are not their concern, only his wealth.
They desire to know nothing of a borrower’s private
virtues or vices, they are only concerned about his
financial or business standing.</p>

<p>Therefore, if it be credit, it is a business, or wealth
credit, a non-moral, not a moral credit, and the superstructure
of credit on which the visionaries gaze is
not a moral superstructure.</p>

<p>If the banks lent only on accommodation paper,
“kites” and such things, this would approach nearer
to our ideas of credit. For accommodation paper is
not representative of real wealth, though it may be
manufactured by a house of strong financial standing.
But banks, I believe, are most vigilant in distinguishing
between “kites” and genuine bills of exchange,
thereby demonstrating unmistakably their hesitation
in depending solely upon business character, and not
upon sound, genuine wealth.</p>

<p>Credit is said to be evidence of civilization; the
higher the civilization the higher the credit, or belief.
Barter was the evidence of barbarism. As man
becomes more intelligent, as his knowledge expands,
as higher ideals lead him on, so he conceives loftier
codes of ethics. As he grows more humane so he
learns to have deeper trust in his neighbour. Knowledge
teaches him how his life depends on the services<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
rendered him by his neighbour, how he would struggle,
and perhaps die, without his neighbour’s help.
Knowledge growing into wisdom teaches him the still
higher truths of altruism and morality. The wise
nation, therefore, endeavouring to live by the higher
morality, is greater than the nation that has not yet
reached this mental and spiritual stage.</p>

<p>The text of this chapter has been partly suggested
by a pregnant passage in Mr. Hartley Withers’ book,
“War and Lombard Street.” The value of the
passage lies in the fact that it echoes the views of
many. Let us examine it and endeavour to grasp
the ideas behind it.</p>

<p>“After all,” says Mr. Withers, “you cannot have
credit without civilization, and at the beginning of
last August civilization went into the hands of a
Receiver, the God of Battles, who will in due course
bring forth his scheme of reconstruction. When the
five chief nations of Europe turn their attention from
production to destruction, it is idle to expect any
system of credit to go unscathed. Credit depends
on the assumption that goods produced will come to
market and be sold, and that securities that are based
on the earning power of production will fetch a price
on the exchanges of the world. War on the smallest
scale weakens this assumption with respect to certain
goods and certain securities; if its scale is big enough
it makes the assumption so precarious that credit is
shaken to its base.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>When we contemplate and analyse civilization we
see two aspects, or conditions, of it. There is a
moral civilization and a non-moral civilization.
Many would contend that Germany presents a type
of non-moral civilization and that Great Britain and
other countries present types of moral civilization.
An advanced stage of economic civilization is not
essentially and implicitly an advanced moral or
ethical civilization. In moral civilization the
Esquimaux may be our superiors. In economic
civilization they are our inferiors. This is largely
due to environment. Rivalry in commerce is not
essentially moral rivalry. We can, indeed, call it
a mercenary, or sordid rivalry, in which virtue and
honesty play minor parts. We may flatter ourselves
that, as a nation, we would gladly be more virtuous
if other nations would let us. This is, at least, an
admission that other nations “do not play the moral
game.” Out of this rivalry wars have sprung, and
the present world-war is one of the fruits of the envy
begotten of our commercial supremacy.</p>

<p>What is the kind of civilization, therefore, that
went into the hands of a Receiver? Germany is
fighting for low civilization, the allies for high
civilization. Indeed, it is said, and not without
truth, that it is not civilization warring with civilization,
but civilization warring against barbarism.
The motives of Germany are debased, the motives
of the allies lofty. If the allies, as all believe, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
been raised in this contest to a high plane of morality—I
might even say to a high plane of spirituality—then
moral civilization may gain, and a higher order
of credit, or belief, may come of it.</p>

<p>From a narrow economic standpoint Germany’s
civilization has been high and may continue high.
But after the war, what will be the state of her moral
civilization? Lower than it has ever been, for
morally she will be degraded. No nations will be
able to put credit, or trust, in her. She will have
forfeited moral trust, forfeited all moral credit. But
will she have forfeited all economic credit? Should
she rehabilitate her economic credit, it will enable us
to see more clearly the distinction between moral and
economic credit.</p>

<p>Her economic state will for a time surely be
weaker. Her finances will be in disorder; her
powers of production and consumption will be
weakened, and it will take her a long time to repair
the ravages to her economic system. This will apply
also in some degree to the allied Powers. They, too,
will have to repair damage to their respective
economic systems.</p>

<p>But we may easily over-estimate the exertions
and the length of time needed to repair those ravages.
If the allies are victorious the moral gains will, at
any rate, be enormous, and these will be tremendous
assets to set against the liabilities. Should they be conquered
we may, indeed, woefully contemplate the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>Should, however, the allies be victorious, why
should credit be shaken to its base? Instead of
being shaken, the base of credit may become stronger
than before. If a higher civilization be the outcome,
then credit must become stronger, because its moral
foundation will be stronger than before.</p>

<p>What is it we mean when we talk of the destruction
of wealth? What wealth is this war destroying?
The war is certainly producing wealth, even though
it may be the most fleeting wealth. The production
of some kind of wealth may temporarily cease, and
where the war has been waged there may have been
great destruction of wealth in devastated cities, towns
and villages. But other permanent wealth is being
produced. Military stores and materials are being
produced in prodigious quantities; but these cannot
be produced without increasing the consumptive
capacity of the nation in other directions, and consumption
is necessary to the production of wealth.
We also have to produce to pay for the materials we
get from abroad and to provide the materials bought
from us by other belligerent countries. There are
now less parasites in this country and more producers.
Even soldiers consume, though they may
produce nothing. But do we always rapidly increase
wealth when, in non-warring times, production far
outruns consumption? Nothing is more familiar
than the destruction of wealth by over-production.
The over-produce not only perishes, but the powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
of consumption are diminished when over-production
throws great numbers out of work.</p>

<p>While, therefore, capital and wealth are being
destroyed—that is to say, a vast amount of capital
is spent that is not reproductive—while soldiers are
killing and not producing, they are consuming, and
those who take their places as new producers can
also consume more, and therefore can, even during
the war, continue to repair the destruction going on.
While destruction is proceeding, construction and
creation are also proceeding. It cannot be all
destruction and no construction. Who, then, can
say how much greater the destruction will be months
hence than the total construction, and how long it
will take to repair the residue destruction?</p>

<p>We cannot confidently estimate. We know we
shall have greater burdens to bear in the shape of
extra taxation. But the conclusion of the war may
greatly lighten these burdens if the blessings of a
complete and lasting peace be as great as we hope
they will be.</p>

<p>What we truly mean by economic credit is economic
confidence. If we eliminated the word “credit” from
our economic vocabulary and always used its synonym
confidence, we should have a clearer grasp of our
ideas. I think Mr. Withers will agree that he really
means confidence. If so, we may amend the passage
and say, “We cannot have confidence without civilization....
Confidence depends on the assumption that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
goods purchased will come to market and be sold—that
is, consumed—and that securities that are based
on the earning power of production, which power
comes from wealth, will fetch a price, high or low,
on the exchanges of the world.”</p>

<p>We ascribe depression in trade to a lack of confidence.
We never say trade is depressed in consequence
of a lack of credit. When trade is depressed there
is often an abundance of what is called Lombard
Street credit. Therefore a scarcity of confidence is
frequently coincident with a superfluity of banking
“credit.” How, therefore, can they be one and the
same thing?</p>

<p>It is confidence that increases wealth, because it
imparts the energy to produce and consume. Capital
without confidence is impotent, as impotent as a
weapon in the hands of a paralytic. Confidence can,
perhaps, re-create as quickly as war can destroy.</p>

<p>If, therefore, victory in the present war comes to
the higher nations and to the greater number of
nations, these, together with the neutral nations, will
be revitalized by confidence. They will have a moral
and a spiritual re-birth. There can be no prolonged
exhaustion, no prolonged prostration in such re-birth.
On the contrary, it will bring economic regeneration
and re-creation.</p>

<p>As the prospects of ultimate victory become more
assured the re-birth and re-creation will begin the
sooner. There are, indeed, no signs of moral or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
economic prostration in this country, and I do not
believe such signs appear in France and Russia.</p>

<p>More evil is done by pessimistic prediction than
we dream of. No man is gifted to see into the
economic future. We have seen already many dark
visions dispelled. There are many prophets amongst
us—some are on the directorates of banks—already
dressed in the mantle of woe, bidding us prepare for
the day of sorrow, when we shall gather the aftermath
of want and misery. The day of sorrow has indeed
come, but, with all respect to the penetrating vision
of these seers, the long day of joy may dawn for us
when this night is ended.</p>

<span class="subhead">CONFIDENCE AND GREATNESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Confidence,</span> I have said, is, in the production of
economic wealth, the vitalizing element. In economics
it plays the part that faith plays in religion. Confidence
and credit have like derivations, like connotations.
Confidence is a confiding in, credit a believing
in. But, we must ask, a confiding or believing in
what? Confidence, the spirit of economic prosperity,
is distinct from what is called Lombard Street credit.
Confidence is vastly more potent than Lombard Street
credit. If confidence be dead Lombard Street credit
cannot of itself revive it. But confidence can revive
Lombard Street credit. When the nation is prostrate
and languid confidence alone can revivify it. It is
the economic tonic.</p>

<p>In the money article it would excite derision if
we wrote: “In Lombard Street to-day confidence
was again in superabundant supply, and lenders were
offering it on nominal terms. Confidence over the
night could be obtained in liberal quantity from
1½ per cent. downwards, and for a week at no more
than 1¾ per cent. In fact, balances of confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
were unlendable. Owing to the cheapness of confidence
the discount market was again exceedingly
weak, and rates continued to fall.”</p>

<p>Yet, it is said, we have built up in this country
a vast superstructure of confidence, or belief, based
on a slight foundation of gold.</p>

<p>Now there may be in Lombard Street, and often
is, a vast amount of “credit,” but merchants and the
public have not the confidence to use it. Why? To
quote Mr. Withers: “Credit depends on the assumption
that goods produced will come to market and be
sold and that securities that are based on the earning
power of production will fetch a price on the exchanges
of the world.” In other words, if we have no confidence
in the future, we are afraid to spend our money.
So we eke it out, or hoard it, or practise thrift and
live in misery. And if we cease to buy we cease
to consume, production diminishes, goods perish in
markets, and men are thrown out of employment.</p>

<p>When we say the credit of the British Government
stands high, we do not mean that the credit-money
of the Government has a high value, or price. We
mean that confidence in the British Government—that
is, in the British nation—is exceedingly strong.
When, therefore, foreigners buy British Consols they
buy them because they know they can have strong
confidence in British wealth and British character:
not because our joint stock banks have high gold
reserves, nor because London is the world’s banker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
and a free market for gold. Foreigners know that
our gold reserves are insignificant compared with the
gold reserves of the leading continental countries, but
they know that Great Britain is the richest and the
<em>greatest</em> country in the world, and the British Empire
the richest and greatest empire the world has seen.</p>

<p>Confidence, therefore, is based ultimately upon
<em>greatness</em>, and our greatness as a nation and an
empire was never more strikingly demonstrated and
vindicated than during the war crisis. Greatness
can exist, therefore, apart from gold reserves.</p>

<p>Let us look back upon the years preceding the
crisis. Let us go back to the American crisis in
1907. This crisis was the result of a lack of confidence
in America’s economic and moral greatness.
It was the result of scandalous dishonesty, the kind
of dishonesty that we know to be impossible in this
country. Yet London could not but be shaken by
the panic there. London was, indeed, shaken by it
more than by the crisis last August. The United
States took gold from London in huge quantities at
a loss, and the Bank of England rate, in order to try
to stop these exports, had to be raised to a high
figure for an indefinite time. Some of our banks
were even accused of assisting the United States to
the hurt of our own banking position. But the storm
was faced and weathered. Years before then it had
faced and weathered another great storm in the
Baring crisis. These historical happenings show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
how mightily strong is that superstructure we have
raised in our midst, whether it be a structure of
paper or of iron.</p>

<p>Then came the Morocco crisis, which was the
beginning of the Stock Exchange depression, and
which has culminated in the European war. When
I speak of Stock Exchange depression I distinguish
it from trade depression, for depression on the Stock
Exchange often coincides with trade activity. The
Morocco crisis brought the fear of war upon the world.
If Germany was prepared one day to fight she began
to make financial preparations for it. There can be
little doubt that she prepared insidiously for this by
depressing in recent years values on the Stock Exchange,
selling securities to weaken us and strengthen
herself. This culminated in the colossal selling
weeks before the war, and in the heavy purchases of
gold in the London bullion market.</p>

<p>There were, however, other unhappy events.
There were the revolution in Mexico, the financial
crises in Argentina and Brazil, the political and
financial crises in France, the Balkan wars, the
labour upheavals in South Africa, the epidemic of
strikes in this country, the failure of the Birkbeck
Bank, the Home Rule crisis, and the financial
troubles of our colonies and heavy borrowings on
their part. One trouble quickly followed another,
peril succeeded peril, and never, perhaps, has the
world struggled amidst such political and financial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
trials. They were years of darkness, and the dawn
of a new and a brighter day seemed remote. The
nations were groping, knowing not what new peril
would confront them. Then the greatest peril of all
came in the world-wide catastrophe.</p>

<p>These constantly occurring troubles could not but
gradually weaken confidence in the future. When
a man gropes his way in an impenetrable fog, in
a place strewn with snares and pitfalls, ignorant of
his whereabouts, knowing not whether he is progressing
or going round in a dangerous circle, he cannot
feel confident of avoiding a fatal end. He can trust
only in hope and in his destiny.</p>

<p>This nation trusted in its destiny. Amidst these
multiplying trials and difficulties it trusted in the
strength of its own soul. Therefore, while prices
were falling on the Stock Exchange, trade was growing
and booming. More capital for trade was needed.
So wealth in the shape of securities was turned into
cash capital, which helped the downfall in stocks and
shares. There was no lack of confidence evidently in
our economic position and future. Our economic
prosperity is not dependent upon Stock Exchange
speculation. The Stock Exchange has often boomed
and flourished during economic depression. This is
because, when we have idle capital or surplus, we
gamble with it, or invest it, if we cannot employ it
profitably in business and commerce. We must
never, therefore, assume that when inactivity reigns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
on the Stock Exchange and prices fall there, and
stocks and shares become depreciated, that the nation
is losing confidence, and that economic stagnation
has come. If prices fall on the Stock Exchange
through political and other causes, and because
merchants and others are turning securities into
cash, the aggregate value of the nation’s wealth may
be rising and accumulating far in excess of the
depreciation on the Stock Exchange. It is probable
that this has been so in recent years. Banks, for
instance, have had to write down their investments
year after year, yet they have earned large profits
and have easily maintained their dividends. They
could not have done this unless their losses in one
direction had been counterbalanced by their gains in
another. So it has been with other great financial
institutions. They have easily kept out of the bankruptcy
court.</p>

<p>We have had a remarkable demonstration, then,
of the power of confidence even in recent years and
in last year’s crisis. The measures taken by the
Government did not weaken that confidence, but
strengthened it.</p>

<p>Take the moratorium, the first real moratorium
this country has experienced. Had academic critics
been told in the beginning of July that war would
break out in the beginning of August, and that the
Government would declare a moratorium, I believe
they would unanimously have predicted disaster,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
complete and irretrievable. If they foresaw disaster
as the certain end of a steady increase in armaments,
nothing short of the fall of the skies would follow
a moratorium. Nothing would more surely precipitate
a panic, for if anything would bring about a state
of bewildering confusion it would be a moratorium.</p>

<p>Once again, then, the imaginative vigour of these
prophets was overrated. It was not equal to the
strain of foreseeing the probable effects of unexperienced
causes. The position was tackled, not by
pedants, but by practical minds; not by nervous
pedagogues, but by bold experts. And the shallow-minded
and timid amongst us were amazed. We
were veritably awe-stricken by the cool skill of our
financial mariners steering us in safety in the unchartered
waters of an unknown sea.</p>

<p>The prolonged Bank holiday, the indefinite closing
of the Stock Exchange, were also decisions that in
prior contemplation would have filled with terror the
hearts of pundits, who unhesitatingly would have
pronounced the doom of the mighty British Empire.
The closing of the Stock Exchange would, in their
convictions, so have stricken down confidence that it
might never arise.</p>

<p>Then there was the subsequent arrangement made
whereby those who had made loans to the Stock
Exchange could obtain from the Bank of England
advances up to 60 per cent. of the value of the
securities held by the lenders against loans outstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
on July 29th. The Bank of England was
not to press for the repayment of these advances
until one year after the conclusion of peace, or after
the expiry of the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act,
1914, whichever should happen first; nor would it
demand in the meantime further margin.</p>

<p>This arrangement has also been highly successful.</p>

<p>The fixing of minimum prices for high-class
securities on the Stock Exchange was another
prudent step. It was artificial, but no one will pretend
that the position in this country and throughout
the world was a natural position. Measures of
precaution and of defence were as necessary to protect
the financial as the military citadel. Were they
not taken, the consequences that might have followed
might in all probability have been immeasurably
worse than the consequences of restricted liberty.
These minimum prices prevented attacks from the
enemy, and, therefore, destruction by the enemy.
The defensive position was greatly strengthened by
the further restrictions imposed by the Treasury
when the Stock Exchange reopened. These were
designed to prevent wholesale selling by enemy
countries and investors; and capitalists in this
country were thereby saved from the incalculable
losses such sales might have occasioned.</p>

<p>All the measures taken by the Government in
this unprecedented crisis must be tested by their
success. Two or three years hence we shall be able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
to survey them in clearer perspective and in truer
proportion. But we can say with assurance even
now that they have been successful. The real
measure of that success we may calculate with
greater certainty some day.</p>

<p>The banking position and the banking system
have stood calm amidst it all. Even had the banks
or the nation possessed that hypothetical reserve
advocated by some, and had it at hand in some safe
corner of London, this would not of itself have made
the position more secure. Other remedial or precautionary
measures would still have had to be
taken. Had it not been the particular measures
that were actually conceived and taken, there would
have been others. But we happened to be fortunate
in the measures that were adopted, measures that
deepened and strengthened the nation’s confidence.</p>

<span class="subhead">FROZEN WEALTH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> are now in a position to look more closely into
the wealth of the banks and at their position in the
early days of the crisis, and to regard them from
what I call the standpoint of confidence. Many
happenings were foretold years ago by the prophets
as the outcome of a European war, but they never
foretold the closing of the Stock Exchange, nor foretold
a moratorium.</p>

<p>I think it will be safe to say that in the closing
days of July no one in this country dreamed that the
Stock Exchange would be closed. I think it will be
safe to say that if this had been foreseen, many
would undoubtedly have predicted disaster as its
consequence. Though the Stock Exchange may be
regarded by moralists and puritans as the shrine of
Mammon, a place frequented only by gamblers and
parasites, it came home to them, as it came home to
the entire nation, that the institution plays a vital
part in our economic organism. If we destroyed it,
we should have to set up a similar institution in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
place. It is the market for the exchange of certain
essential species of the community’s wealth.</p>

<p>The closing of the Stock Exchange not only froze
up a considerable portion of the wealth possessed
by banks, but a far mightier portion of wealth possessed
by the general community. The banks could
not liquefy their wealth, and the community could
not liquefy its wealth. Their wealth was useless
to both. There was no market for it, and when
markets no longer work, the machinery of exchange,
of production and distribution, works more slowly,
and in some directions comes to a standstill. This
was one market, but, as I have said, it was a vital
market. Its closing restricted the power of the
banks to liquefy capital, it restricted the facilities
of merchants, tradesmen, and others to exchange
investments for cash, or liquid capital. In other
words, it had the same effect as the destruction of a
vast amount of capital, and trade and employment
suffered accordingly.</p>

<p>Banks, therefore, found themselves in possession
of unsaleable securities, those they held as collateral
for loans and those in which their reserve funds were
invested. The Stock Exchange owed to them approximately
£80,000,000. Unable, therefore, to realize
this wealth and to call in their loans, their position
was considerably weakened.</p>

<p>Then there was that other mass of wealth held as
security against advances to customers, which in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
times was also unrealizable. The market for this
class of wealth was practically destroyed. The exchange
machinery came to a stop.</p>

<p>It was inevitable, too, that on the outbreak of so
colossal a war, the foreign exchanges would break
down. International trading was thrown immediately
into a state of confusion. It was faced with all
the complicated risks of sea-warfare, contraband
declarations, neutral nation rights, insurance, freights,
and the thousand and one unforeseen difficulties
arising from warfare between great maritime nations.
Debtors to this country could not remit money or
goods to liquidate their debts, and debtors here could
not redeem their debts abroad.</p>

<p>As pointed out in former chapters, prophets always
confidently foretold that one immediate result of such
a war would be a raid on our gold stores by foreign
countries. Our actual experiences showed how feeble
were these imaginings. They were too feeble to
foresee the impossibility of exporting great masses
of gold abroad. Our navy would stop their exportation
to enemy countries, whilst risks of capture,
freights and insurance would stop their export to
neutral countries. It was rumoured that the British
Government placed an embargo on exports of gold.
This is highly improbable, for the embargoes imposed
by the war were sufficiently preventative; certainly
so in the early months of the war.</p>

<p>But apart from these tremendous difficulties and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
obstacles, it was vastly more important to discover that
we had greater power to take gold from foreign countries
than foreigners had to take it from us, thereby again
destroying theories. It was revealed that this country
was, indeed, the world’s creditor; that nations were
indebted to us, not we to them. This was why, with
few exceptions, notably the French Exchange, the
exchanges went in our favour. This was violently
so with the New York Exchange, which consequently
broke down completely. America was greatly in this
country’s debt, and as it could not liquidate in the
ordinary way by buying exchange on London, New
York had eventually to send gold to Ottawa. This,
together with our subsequent huge military purchases
in the States, gradually improved the position, and
in a few months the exchange was working normally.</p>

<p>Our banks called in credits from abroad, but our
debtors, with all the good will in the world, could not
remit the funds. Not only did this place the discount
and accepting houses in serious difficulties, but the
banks were involved in these difficulties. The wealth,
therefore, which in normal times the banks regard as
next to their cash reserves in matter of quality, was
practically of no avail. Bills of exchange became
as frozen as Stock Exchange securities, and naturally
enough the banks forthwith ceased to discount bills.
And as the bill brokers depend on the banks, they
could not discount. Moreover, it was useless at
first to call in loans from the bill brokers, for they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
could not get the funds. So the deadlock was
complete.</p>

<p>What, then, was the most expedient thing for the
Government to do in these unprecedented circumstances?
Let things take their course? Let the
problem solve itself? In that direction disaster lay.
Even though the banks might stand up, the nation’s
commercial and economic position could not stand
up. Dire confusion would have resulted; ruin would
have followed; there would have been unemployment
on a vast scale; and the nation would have been in
an infinitely weaker position than it was to face and
conduct the war. The problem was solved by the
moratorium; and the difficulties and complications
arising out of the moratorium were subsequently
removed by degrees by the other measures adopted.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the highest human wisdom
to grasp in its entirety and instantly the vast problem
that had to be faced. No guidance was to be got
from tradition or precedent. It was like sudden ruin
overtaking an ordinary prosperous and comfortable
household. The disaster not having been foreseen,
and no provision having been made for it, the head
of the household is in a state of bewilderment. He
cannot at first see and think clearly. It is only by
force of will and self-control that he finds a way to
battle with his troubles and difficulties, and to minimize
and overcome them.</p>

<p>So with the Government of the national household.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
It had to exercise self-control, self-will, act
boldly and act firmly, adopting what appeared the
wisest course, not staying to ask what our forefathers
did or would have done. The nation’s ancestors
never had such trials and difficulties to face, such
problems to settle.</p>

<p>The only action the wisdom of which I have
doubts, was the rapid advance in the Bank of England
rate to 10 per cent. It is possible that this would
have had graver consequences had the bulk of the
public understood the meaning of it. To those who
understood it looked like the symptoms of panic.
Fortunately, the bulk of the public did not understand
the significance of it. In its ignorance it regarded
it as something wisely and inevitably done,
a greater safeguard and, therefore, a measure designed
to strengthen and not weaken its confidence in the
banking and financial position.</p>

<p>Those versed in its meaning were able to discount
its importance. Now, however, that recent experiences
have greatly enlightened the public, it would
be well to take this lesson to heart.</p>

<p>The object of raising the rate was, presumably,
to protect the Bank’s reserve, and to draw gold from
abroad. No rate, however, will protect the reserve
in the day of world-wide panic, and no rate will bring
gold here in such a world-war. Scarcely was it raised
than it had to be brought down again. If it had to
be legally raised to 10 per cent. before emergency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
currency could be issued, the sooner this piece of
red tape is destroyed the better.</p>

<p>However, it is hardly likely that a crisis of the
dimensions we have experienced will recur. Should
it recur some generations hence, the Government in
those days will have experience and precedent to
guide them.</p>

<p>Though the greater part of the wealth of the
banks was frozen in these early days, owing to the
circumstances I have mentioned, and they had only
their cash wealth to carry them through, there was
no panic. The stability of the banking structure was
not assailed by a tempest, and its position never
seemed in real peril. A zephyr might have blown
about it, but not a hurricane. Its foundations never
swerved visibly. Let us recall, too, that the crisis
occurred at an unfortunate time in the days when
there are heavy calls upon the banks for holiday
cash. If they paid depositors largely in notes, they
fulfilled their legal obligations, and their action in
this respect must be judged in the light of the legal
restrictions on which I have laid emphasis in former
chapters. If depositors had to go to the Bank of
England to exchange their notes for gold, this was no
proof of a panicky run on the Bank of England.
Moreover, there can be little doubt that in all their
elaborate scheming prior to the war, the Germans
prepared to start a panic by a fictitious run on the
Bank. But this plan failed as egregiously as their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
plans to bring about revolution in India and the
colonies.</p>

<p>So far as the depositors were concerned the
banks had little need to claim the protection of the
moratorium. The system soon began to work as
smoothly and as perfectly as in normal times.</p>

<p>For all that, it is a pity that years ago the
Government did not take power on its own behalf, or
give provisional power to the Bank of England, to
issue legal tender notes of £1 and 10<i>s.</i> denomination.
Notes of high denomination are useless for ordinary
currency purposes. The recent crisis has demonstrated,
once and for all, their uselessness. Because
this provision had never been made, and because the
country had no machinery for providing small
currency in emergencies, new machinery had to be
improvised. This entailed delay, which, though it
had no grave consequences, resulted in needless loss.
It was responsible in chief measure for the prolonged
holiday, which was a joy to some people and a sorrow
to others. However, now that we have the machinery,
let us keep it to use, not to abuse. After all, very
little of the new paper currency has been needed.</p>

<p>Having, then, in the crisis only their cash
reserves to rely upon, those reserves which some
critics have constantly insisted have ever been too
slender, the banks came through comfortably,
successfully, thoroughly justifying the confidence
reposed in them. This confidence has strengthened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
as the days have gone by. It shows that confidence
is of greater value than “credit.” Such a statement
takes on the aspect of a paradox. Though wealth
was frozen, and though the creation of the highest
class of wealth was greatly slowed down, verging on
stoppage, still confidence remained. This appears to
me to be confidence not only in the soundness of our
banking system, but confidence in our entire economic
structure, in the wisdom of Government, in the
wealth of the nation, in the strength of our army and
navy, in the holiness of our crusade, and in the
strength of our national character. But would this
confidence remain were our banking system to fall?
As Mr. Lloyd George said in Parliament, the mere
knowledge of the currency facilities being available
gave confidence. That is, it strengthened confidence
in the nation’s financial fabric.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOME CONCLUSIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> writing this work I need hardly say—for it will be
apparent to all who have laboured through it—that I
have had two main purposes in view. I have written
it as a guide to the student of the money market,
and I have written it with the object of learning
some lessons which, I think, are to be learnt from the
unique experiences of the financial world since the
outbreak of the war. There is much contentious
matter within its pages, but this is inevitable in
dealing with a subject so profound and intricate, so
profound, indeed, as well nigh to baffle human vision
to see clearly, steadily, and wholly its vast complexities.
The financial fabric is something that has
grown up in our midst as a mysterious thing. It has
arisen not only out of our needs, but out of our
national character. It is no invention that has
suddenly revolutionized fashion in banking. It has
been an economic evolution, a product of environment,
and who will say that its evolution has
reached its final stage? The environment has been
gradually, inevitably, imperceptibly created and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
modified by national character, that is to say, by
national psychology. This explains its distinction
from other systems. Other systems in the world
are likewise products of national character, products
of circumscribed environment. This is why they
differ, and why there is no scientific precision.
There may come a time when the world will have an
international banking system, but that day is far
distant. Meanwhile systems must remain national.</p>

<p>It is important, therefore, for the student to
understand that it is a psychological product, a
something that has grown up out of the soul of the
nation. It is difficult to be clearly conscious of this,
to regard it as a something not purely scientific,
something not independent of human nature as are
mathematics. Banking is a part of our economic
system. Political economy has been called a dismal
science. This is a delusion. It is neither a science,
nor is it dismal. Students of political economy have
made it look dismal because they have regarded it as
a science, in the making of whose laws and in the
shaping of which human nature and constantly
changing character have no part. Political economy
is a branch of psychology. The subject is human
nature, in the same way as ethics or religion is
human nature. It deals with temperament and the
soul, and the temperament and the soul are not
strictly scientific subjects, like geology and astronomy.
We might just as reasonably describe religion as the
science of theological economy, and ethics as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
science of moral economy, as describe social intercourse
as political economy. If political economy
means the law of the State, then laws are made by
the citizens of a nation and are being constantly
modified. They are not laws beyond the control of
man.</p>

<p>The banking system is in our control and we can
make laws to modify it as we please, and as our
wisdom dictates, or counsels. In gold there is
nothing marvellous. The world has given it certain
powers through its laws. One nation has largely
imitated another in this respect, until all the leading
nations have adopted it as the basis of their systems.
They have imitated each other in the same way in
evolving their naval and military systems. The day
may come when they will look upon gold as something
barbaric, in the same light as we regard the
iron currency of primitive nations. A thousand years
hence ours may be spoken of as a primitive age.</p>

<p>In this work, then, I have endeavoured not only
to be analytical and critical, but to be constructive.
Many of the theories that are still held tenaciously I
cannot accept. I cannot accept the theory that banks
are creators of credit and build up an unsubstantial
and dangerous structure. When we talk of banking
credit and national credit we talk of two distinct conceptions.
Yet both kinds of credit are based fundamentally
on national wealth and national character.
It is said that banking credit is based on gold and
national credit on national wealth. Why is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
national credit also based on gold? We glory in a
towering national credit, because it is something to
be proud of, a monument to our greatness. Why, then,
should banking credit raise strong apprehensions?</p>

<p>Before we talk glibly of banking credit it would
be more profitable, first of all, to get a clear conception
of what credit is, and having got that clear
conception to define it clearly. Joint stock companies
talk of other credits. They describe revenue
as credit, profits as credit, debts owing to them as
credit, their financial standing as credit. Ideas of
credit, therefore, are greatly complicated, and no
wonder they lead to confusion. We even talk of
Germany’s credit weakening, notwithstanding the
great mass of gold she possesses.</p>

<p>It is when we talk of credit and confidence as one
and the same thing that the confusion becomes
greater. We talk of the superstructure of credit
raised by banks, and grow dizzy as we strain our
gaze towards its apex; yet we speak in the same
breath of the profound confidence we have in banks.
We cannot at the same moment have profound
confidence in them and yet gaze apprehensively
upon the system. The repose and the fear cannot
both be rational states of consciousness.</p>

<p>Our confidence in banks reposes in our trust in
the wealth they possess and in the wealth they
transform into money. Without that confidence
they could not exist, despite their credit. But without
confidence the nation itself could not exist. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
is national confidence that supports the State. It is
national confidence that brings national prosperity.
Destroy confidence and you destroy wealth and
prosperity.</p>

<p>As regards bank reserves, I think we can do in
the future what we have done in the past—trust them
to keep a fair average proportion. As things are,
we must not expect the system to work with perfect
elasticity. This cannot be done with inelastic gold
as a basis. We cannot have an absolutely safe
mathematical ratio. Whatever the ratio be, it alone
will not ensure us against disaster. Only the
Government—that is, the nation—can ensure us
against disaster. It is the duty of the nation to do
this, and it is also a prudent course to take. We
had an exemplification of this in the recent crisis.
Experience is a safer guide than theory.</p>

<p>But the Government, in its turn, has the right
and the duty to insist upon sound banking. It
should allow no institutions to spring up calling
themselves banks which cannot be conducted soundly.
This is not safeguarding the community. Such
institutions should be differentiated, and should have
their proper designations. I think the fewer the
banks the better, therefore I favour amalgamations.
This is because I think they could be brought under
more complete control and could be more soundly
and safely administrated. In fact, I would go to the
logical extreme and make them branches of a State
Bank and not independent entities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>It is because they and the Bank of England are
independent entities that we cannot simultaneously
have high reserves in the joint stock banks and high
reserves in the Bank of England unless both stop
lending simultaneously. A joint stock bank singly
can keep a high proportion because it can make all
its branches conform to the common policy. But as
the banks are not branches of the Bank of England
there can be no common policy. This has its grave
disadvantages at times. We may evolve in time to
closer union, to a more consistent and uniform
system. This certainly lies in the path of social
evolution.</p>

<p>As to where the reserves should be kept, I do not
think, as the system is at present, that this is a
question of vital importance. The reserves appear
to me to be safer in the Bank of England, because
thereby they place greater obligations upon that
Bank, and this comes nearer to our notions of unity.
Behind the Bank of England is the Government, and
behind the Government is the State. One thing is
certain. Wherever the reserves be, they will not
suffice of themselves to save the banks in a state of
ungovernable panic without the help of the Government.
And all the banks must stand or fall together.
And if they stand or fall together their reserves must
be pooled in some fashion and somewhere.</p>

<p>The Government can save them in these grave,
but, happily, remote circumstances, by setting the
machinery at work to produce legal tender currency.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
The wisdom and efficacy of this have recently been
strikingly demonstrated.</p>

<p>Many critics have foretold disaster from the
inadequacy of the gold reserves against the liabilities
in the Post Office Savings Bank. The Post Office
Savings Bank and the joint stock banks perform
distinct functions. The Savings Bank does not lend.
It does not transform wealth into liquid currency.
It is a huge State safe, where public savings are kept
in safety, and it performs the functions of the old
silver teapot in the household. Being a purely
State or National institution, it is a national liability.
It has behind it the entire wealth of the nation, and
it is absolutely safe unless the nation be swallowed
up in the seas. And if it were swallowed up the
depositors would not need their money.</p>

<p>Gold, after all, performs but limited functions. It
is becoming less necessary in the internal economy of
the State owing to the growth of cheques. Gold is
merely a symbol, and we should not bow before it in
abject obeisance. It is even becoming of less importance
in its international functions, and I think the
European war will lessen its importance still further.
European nations have collected it more for war
purposes than for commercial. This has been the
case with Germany, which, in the consciousness
of its determination to fight for world dominion,
amassed the gold as a war chest. This gold is not in
circulation, but is lying idle in the Reichsbank, in
order that the Government may flood the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
with various sorts of paper currency. This paper
currency will in time be so inflated as to become
greatly depreciated. This is the danger run, the
danger of inflation and depreciation, yet we never
dream of the inflation of our cheque currency, because
it grows and contracts with our output of wealth.</p>

<p>The depreciation of paper currency is evidence
often that a nation is living beyond its income. We
know the fate awaiting the individual when he “outruns
the constable.” In order to avoid insolvency he
must live more frugally, live well within his income,
and liquidate his debts. Then, in time, he will be
free and will not live in dread of his creditors.</p>

<p>If a nation lived within itself, built a huge rampart
around itself, and had no commercial intercourse
with other nations, if it could live a happy, contented
community, on its own resources, then an inflated
currency would have no ill effects. It would not
necessarily bring bankruptcy and ruin. It would be
like a private individual living on his own resources
and on the fruits of his own labour, interchanging
nothing with his neighbours. Such a hermit would
be indebted to no man. He would depend on nature
alone, and if nature failed him, or sickness overtook
him, then he would die.</p>

<p>But civilized nations are not hermit nations.
They live by mutual help, by mutual trading. They
deal with each other and they deal on the system of
barter, in the absence of an international currency.
Gold is a species of barter and passes from nation to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
nation in all respects like an ordinary commodity.
Imports are paid for by exports, and exports pay for
imports. When, however, a country imports more
than it can pay for in exports, it must either cease to
import, or pay for the excess in gold, securities, or
some other form of payment. If it has to pay in gold
it may be living beyond its income and be paying for
its exports out of capital. If the gold be hoarded and
the paper currency be multiplied and inflated an
automatic rise in prices results. This is tantamount
to a depreciation of the paper currency, for this
currency can then purchase less. What is called the
credit of the nation falls. That is to say, belief in
its soundness weakens. This encourages imports
from foreign countries and discourages exports, and
the indebtedness to foreign countries increases.
Should this go on indefinitely, the country will get
deeper and deeper into debt and nearer to insolvency.
It will have to pay for its imports with its gold, or
stop importing. And if it stops importing, it might
stop importing vital products. Powers of production
and consumption will necessarily weaken, and that
country will get into the plight Germany has got into.
In time its credit and currency will become so debased
that foreigners will not risk exporting commodities,
lest they should lose more than they gain, for the
debtor country’s paper will become of less value.</p>

<p>In the case of Russia, her currency also became
depreciated in terms of sterling value. This arose
from a different cause. Russia’s exports to England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
and other countries were stopped by the closing of
the Baltic Sea and the Dardanelles. A little went
by the Archangel route, but, of course, it was wholly
inadequate. Russia, therefore, was unable to liquidate
her national indebtedness by her exports, and the
exchange went so greatly against her—that is to say,
the rouble became so greatly depreciated in terms of
our gold currency—that it was impossible for Russian
merchants to get remittances to send to this country
to liquidate their indebtedness here.</p>

<p>The war crisis has been invaluable in teaching
us deep lessons. Had there been machinery for the
ready provision of legal tender currency the moment
the war was foreseen, a moratorium might have been
unnecessary, with all its complications and confusion.
A prolonged Bank holiday, with its inconveniences,
might likewise have been obviated. The crisis has
shown enlightened nations how terrible the risks and
consequences of war are. It has been invaluable in
revealing the spiritual, material, and financial strength
of Great Britain and the Empire, and in setting up
precedents for future guidance in the financial as well
as in the military and commercial spheres. And the
heavy financial burdens shouldered by the nation may
not in the long run be so heavy as some fear.</p>

<span class="subhead">MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN AND MR. LLOYD
GEORGE ON GOLD RESERVES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">While</span> this book was in the press, interesting views upon
the note currency and the gold reserves were expressed in
the House of Commons by Mr. Austen Chamberlain and
Mr. Lloyd George. They coincide largely with my own
views. The opinions were expressed during the discussion
on February 23rd on the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s
statement on the financial arrangements made with France
and Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. Austen Chamberlain said, to quote from the report
in the <cite>Morning Post</cite>:—</p>

<p>“Mr. D.&nbsp;M. Mason the previous night urged the Government
to withdraw the Treasury notes now in circulation
here. He (Mr. Chamberlain) had held for a long time
that gold in the pockets of the people was not a very useful
reserve for any national purpose, that we carried about
the same amount of gold whether it was a time of crisis or
not, and that that gold was not readily made available for
the international currency when the need for it in that
capacity arose. Therefore, he held that the internal
circulation of gold was, on the whole, wasteful use of it,
that it was an out of date use of gold, and that the
greatest development of our financial system had been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
substitution of paper for gold. The largest substitution
had been in the form of the cheque. Provided that the
issue of notes was not an artificial inflation of the currency
but a response to a real need for currency, then the
more they could substitute notes for gold for internal use
the better, and the more economical, the more civilized,
and the more advanced the currency system became.
What he cared about was seeing a large reserve of gold
centralized for use in an emergency, and if they had
secured the reserve of gold and the emergency arose, then
the most foolish thing they could do was to fail to use the
gold. The gold was got together in order that in an
emergency, when the exchange went against them, the
adverse balance of the exchanges might be corrected by
the use of the gold, and unless the gold were used in that
way it seemed to be a pure waste of it to hold it in reserve.
That was not a doctrine that was popular in any
foreign country that he knew. But it was a sound
doctrine, and he hoped that the whole influence that we
could bring, through the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in
the councils of the Allies would be directed to making
them use their gold resources freely when those gold
resources were required. They had to study the psychology
of the people. If the Government used their gold freely
they very soon restored confidence in the public mind.
He hoped that our influence would be used to persuade
our Allies that in this matter the boldest course was the
safest course, and that States were as unwise to hoard gold
as individuals within States were.” (Hear, hear.)</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd George, in the course of his speech, said:
“As to the matter of currency, he was completely in
agreement with Mr. Chamberlain, who put the position so
effectively that he could not usefully add anything. He
thought it desirable that there should be considerable
reserves of gold in the Bank of England or in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
Treasury, and equally desirable that it should be freely
used whenever the emergency arose. We were on the
road to a much more efficient use of our gold reserve if
we used paper currency within safe limits. Our issues of
paper currency were well within safe limits. (Hear, hear.)
Not only so, but there was no country to be compared with
us in this respect. Foreign countries, he thought, had
always been nervous about using their gold. The fact
that we used it freely showed that was not our view.
There was too much disposition even to-day to worship the
golden calf. (Laughter.) This country had always gone
on the principle that the gold was there to use whenever
there was a demand for it, and that practice had never failed
us up to the present. It was true that we had never had
such a strain put upon it as during the past few months, and
it was probable that that strain would increase during the
next six or twelve months, when our purchases abroad would
be much heavier than ever before, and our sales to other
countries considerably less. He did not like to prophesy,
and he hated bragging, but he did not mind saying that
the resources of gold we had got would carry us through
any emergency that we could possibly foresee. (Cheers.)
That was his firm conviction, not merely from his observation,
but from careful inquiries in the City and elsewhere.
He agreed, however, that there was no special merit in
paying debts in gold where paper would do equally well,
and thought it wasteful, burdensome, and not particularly
useful.”</p>
